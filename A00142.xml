            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:473:5"/> hauing touched it before in my Epiſtle to the Prince, and made it ſo apparent throughout my whole Booke, as that the reader may decerne it running.

            <p>Thus we ſee in what manner the poſteritie of <hi>Gomer</hi> (the <hi>Gaules</hi> our next neighbours) firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and poſſeſſed this Iſland, being the vttermoſt confines of <hi>Europe.</hi> And herein the prouidence of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:473:9"/> God is alſo to be obſerued, who by the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the name of our firſt parent in this part of the world, foreſhewed his purpoſe therein. For <hi>Gomer</hi> in the holy tongue, is by tranſlation into <hi>Latin, Finiens,</hi> that is, <hi>termining</hi> and <hi>ending,</hi> as <hi>Melancton</hi> noteth.</p>
            <p>It may be further demanded what affinitie in pronunciation and ſound haue theſe words, <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merites</hi> or <hi>Gomeries</hi> with the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> language? I anſwer, not a little.

            <p>How commeth it then to paſſe, that this Iſland hath beene ſome-times called <hi>Albion,</hi> and more lately <hi>Britaine,</hi> which names can by no meanes be etimologed, either from <hi>Gomerie, Kumerie,</hi> or the <hi>Gaules,</hi> the firſt inhabitance thereof, as hath beene prooued?

As for example, they called the <hi>Chuſians</hi> (who tooke that name of <hi>Chus</hi> their firſt parent,) <hi>Aethiopians</hi> of their blackneſſe: So it may well be that they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this Iland <hi>Albion,</hi> of the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which ſignifieth White (whereof the <hi>Alpes</hi> take their name) becauſe vpon the Sea coaſts many white Rocks appeare to ſuch as paſſe by the ſame.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:473:10"/> And the <hi>Welch-men</hi> doe at this day call this land in their language <hi>Iniſwen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inis gwyn.</note> that is, the <hi>White Iland.</hi> Or elſe they called it <hi>Albion,</hi> of <hi>Albion</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Neptune,</hi> in like maner as they vainely and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly call Italie <hi>Heſperia</hi> of <hi>Heſperus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Atlas,</hi> &amp; as they called <hi>Gallia, Gallatia</hi> of a daughter of <hi>Poliphemus</hi> of that name.

            </p>
            <p>As for the other name <hi>Britania,</hi> I preferre the opinion of Maiſter <hi>Camden,</hi> who compoundeth the ſame of the word <hi>Brit</hi> or <hi>Brith,</hi> which in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> tongue ſignifieth <hi>Painted,</hi> and of <hi>Tania</hi> a <hi>Greeke</hi> word ſignifying <hi>Region</hi> or <hi>Country.</hi> So as <hi>Britania</hi> is as much to ſay, as <hi>the country of the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men.</hi> The <hi>Latines</hi> receiued the name <hi>Britaniae</hi> from the <hi>Graecians,</hi> as they did theſe other, <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenia,</hi> that is, the country of the <hi>Moores.

Of this word <hi>Brith</hi> a <hi>Briton</hi> is called in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtories <hi>Brithon.</hi> And no doubt the <hi>Romaines</hi> afterwards called the <hi>Britons, Picti,</hi> of the cuſtome they had to Painte themſelues; <q>—Nec falſo nomine Pictos:—Edomuit</q> (ſaith <hi>Claudian</hi> the Poet) He tamed the <hi>Pictes,</hi> not vntruly ſo called of their cuſtome to Painte
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:473:10"/> their bodies. And <hi>Iſiodore: Non abest genti Picto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum nomen à corpore, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Pictes</hi> (ſaith hee) wanted not a denomination of a cuſtome they had to paint them-ſelues. For hauing with a Needle pricked ſome part of their bodies, they infuſed there-into certaine colours of hearbes and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for an ornament to the better ſort amongſt them: neither were theſe <hi>Picts</hi> any other then the naturall <hi>Britaines,</hi> who refuſing to become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> abandoned themſelues into the furtheſt parts of the land Northwards, where liuing vnto them-ſelues, they retained their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and barbarous cuſtomes, from which the other <hi>Britaines</hi> were reclaimed by the ciuill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> who there-vpon for diſtinction ſake, gaue to thoſe Northerne <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> (then become enimies to the other) the name of <hi>Picts.</hi> But by <hi>Dion, Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Herodian,</hi> they were neuer otherwiſe called, then by the common name to the people of this nation, <hi>viz.

Auſonius</hi> calleth them the <hi>Caledian Britaines,</hi> becauſe they inhabited the more hard and barraine part of the Iland, for <hi>Kaledon</hi> in the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> tongue ſignifieth as much. Thus wee haue attained (I take it) the certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what people firſt inhabited this our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and how it came by the former ancient names.</p>
            <p>Now it followeth, that I ſhould declare what forraine nations haue from time to time, come
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:473:11"/> from other partes, and ſought habitation heere alſo. It apeareth manifeſtlie by the ſearch of all ancient recordes, that vntill the comming of the <hi>Romaines</hi> this Iland was neuer attempted by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſion, neither is there any memory made of the <hi>Brittaines</hi> vntill that time. But when <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> that valiant and mightie Conqueror had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed the <hi>Gaules</hi> euen vnto the coaſt ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, and there beholding a newe vnknowne worlde, offring it ſelfe as it were a preie to his hautie minde, hee had not the power to confine his Conqueſtes with the Ocean, but to giue the more glorie vnto his name and his nation, hee forth-with addreſſed him ſelfe for the conqueſt of the ſame, and hauing prouided all things fit for ſo valerous an exploite, with much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſmall aduantage hee ariued here in the foure and fiftith yeare before the incarnation of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, with which intertainement being much diſcontented he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, but returning the next ſpring better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, he preuailed ſo much againſt <hi>Caſsibelan</hi> and his <hi>Britaines,</hi> that the king beeing vnwilling to hazard the loſſe of the whole land, perſwaded his compeers to become tributarie to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Monarchie. <hi>Caeſar</hi> here-with ſatiſfied; at the approch of winter departed home-wards, hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaieth) only ſhewed <hi>Britaine</hi> to his nation, for during the ſpace of twentie years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as <hi>Dion</hi> his words import) the <hi>Britaines</hi> were

The enemy beeing repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Realme by their helpe reduced to a more quiet eſtate, the <hi>Saxons</hi> became ſo farre in loue and liking with this Land, that they had no good will to returne home againe. Wherefore beeing growne to a mighty People (for daylie they ſtill flocked hither) vnder ſome colourable pretence of quarrell, they became friends (for the time) with the <hi>Pictes</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> and bent all their force againſt the <hi>Brittaines.</hi> Thus were they brought to a moſt miſerable eſtate by them in whom they repoſed greateſt confidence, not foreſeeing how dangerous a thing it is for any nation to entertaine a forraine aide, ouer-mighty to bee commanded at their pleaſure. For after ſome reſiſtance made by thoſe two Martiall <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Princes <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius,</hi> and King <hi>Arthur,</hi> in the end they were expelled out off the more

After an hundred and fortye yeares from thence his ſucceſſors brought vnder their ſubiection the two other Prouinces. So that in the end the former Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchie was reduced to a Monarchie,</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Saxons</hi> were not all one people but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of three ſeuerall Nations. <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Angles</hi> (who as it appeareth by their poſſeſſions heere, were the greateſt number) the <hi>Iutes,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Saxons,</hi> but they were all the Inhabitants of ſome part or other of <hi>Denmarke.</hi> For proofe whereof, beſides the authoritie of <hi>Bede,</hi> Maiſter <hi>Camden</hi> citeth an ancient Author, <hi>Fabius Ethelwardus</hi> who writeth thus.

            <p>Theſe people were generally addicted to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious paganiſme ſacrificing humaine fleſh to their Idolls, among whom <hi>Wooden</hi> and <hi>Fria</hi> were of greateſt account.

Hereby it appeareth that by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the <hi>Saxons</hi> the profeſſion of Chriſt, which before had taken ſome little roote, was now exterpate &amp; plucked vp. But after 150. years from their firſt arriuall it pleaſed the Lord to enlighten their vnderſtanding by the reading of his word, with ſome knowledge of him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom <hi>Ethelbert</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi> was the firſt King that together with his ſubiects receiued Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me (the badge of our profeſſion) at the hands of <hi>Augustin,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>
               <hi>Egbert</hi> hauing reſumed the title of abſolute King ouer the whole Land, and promiſing vnto himſelfe and his poſteritie, the ſole Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer the ſame: the height of his conceiued happineſſe was ſodainly ſhaken by a mighty tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt out off the Eaſt againe. For the <hi>Danes</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing here in his time, did afterwardes ſo much preuaile againſt the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> as that within the ſpace of two hundred yeares, <hi>Swane</hi> King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> hauing attained the poſſeſſion of the whole Realme, left the ſame vnto <hi>Canutus</hi> his ſonne, who together with his two ſonnes did ſucceſſiuely raigne one after another about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares. After the death of the two brothers the gouernement of the Land returned to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> bloud in the perſon of King <hi>Edward</hi> ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Confeſſor, in whom alſo it ended for a ſeaſon. This ſeruitude vnder the <hi>Danes</hi> was more grieuous then any other before or after it, as <hi>Hollinſhead</hi> well obſerueth. For the <hi>Romaines</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all kind of curteſie to thoſe <hi>Brittaines</hi> which continued in dutifull obedience, alwayes defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from their enemies malice, &amp; admitting them kings and rulers of their owne nation. The <hi>Saxons,</hi> and the <hi>Normans</hi> hauing in ſhort time attained the Soueraignty, gaue ſpeedy end to the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:473:18"/> miſeries and miſchieues incident to a conqueſt. But the <hi>Danes</hi> a long time moleſting the land by their ſeuerall inuaſions, did not ſo much deſire to become conquerors, as to make a continuall ſpoile and prey of the inhabitants, whereby the Land was moſt extremely vexed and impoueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Danes</hi> were a people, that long after the ariual of the <hi>Saxons</hi> here, ſucceeded them in their former habitations, beeing tranſported thither out of the eaſterne Countries, from ſome part of <hi>Scandia,</hi> of whome theſe peninſule or Ile-like prouinces firſt tooke the name of <hi>Dane-marſhe,</hi> becauſe they lie low, ſubiect to the ouer flowing of the ſea, according to the nature of mariſh ground. Now the Country by corruption of ſpeech is called <hi>Denmarke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt conqueſt ouer this land was made by the <hi>Normans.</hi> The manner whereof Maiſter <hi>Camden</hi> (now <hi>Clarentiaulx</hi> king at armes) hath very compendiouſly deliuered in the Latin tongue, wherefore it ſhalbe ſufficient for mee in this place to followe him word by word in as good <hi>Engliſh</hi> as I can make him ſpeake, as as for the moſt part I haue done hitherto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the confeſſor being dead without iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, the nobles and commons were at there witts end, how to reſolue about the admittance of a new King. <hi>Edgar</hi> (ſurnamed <hi>Atheling</hi>) grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child to <hi>Edmond Ironſide</hi> by his Father was the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:473:18"/> onely iſſue male of the <hi>Saxon</hi> bloud, to whome the crowne by right of inheritance pertayned. But he beeing thought vnfit to gouerne by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his minority, and hauing beene alſo bred and brought vp in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> by his Mother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathe</hi> Daughter to the Emperour <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, was not ſo gratious in the eyes of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen,</hi> who regarded nothing more, then to haue one to raigne ouer them of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore both the eies and heartes well neere of all men were wholie fixed and ſetled in affection vpon <hi>Harold</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Godwine</hi> highlie honored and renowned for his ſinguler dexterity in managing the affaires of eſtate, as well in time of warre as of peace. For although hee had no cauſe to boaſt of Nobility, receauing that onelie of his Mothers ſide, and that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſtayned himſelfe with a perpetuall note of infamie. Neuertheleſſe by his curtious car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards all men, his liberality, and manlie corrage, hee was generally exceedingly fauored. Neither was their any other in whome was found more boldneſſe to incounter an intended miſchiefe, or of better foreſight how to auoide it. His late victory ouer the <hi>Welchmen</hi> was ſo glorious in the iudgement of the people, that he ſeemed to want no good accomplement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in a great Commander as though he had purpoſely beene borne to reſtore and vphold the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Empire.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:473:19"/>
            <p>As for the <hi>Danes</hi> who were then the greateſt terror to this nation, It was hoped hee ſhould finde them fauorable enough becauſe <hi>Edithe</hi> his mother was ſiſter to <hi>Swane</hi> then King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke.</hi> If any other reſiſtance ſhould ariſe either at home or elſe-where, hee ſeemed to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently garded not onely by the hands and heartes of the communalty, but alſo by his affinity in bloud, &amp; alliance with the nobility, for his wife was ſiſter to the two brothers <hi>Morkar</hi> and <hi>Edwine</hi> the greateſt men in the Land, and <hi>Edrick</hi> ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the foreſter (a man of an aſpiring minde and in high authority) was alſo neerelie allied vnto him. Withall it fell out fortunatly for him that the <hi>Daniſh</hi> King was then ſet on worke at home by his enimy the <hi>Sweaden.</hi> And <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was nothing gracious to the <hi>Normaine</hi> Duke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee much miſliked that <hi>Edward</hi> the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour had in the time of his baniſhment and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade in <hi>Normandie,</hi> couenanted to make the Duke his heire to the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> after him, if hee ſhould deceaſe without iſſue of his bodie. For the performance whereof <hi>Harold</hi> had offered to become his ſuretie and aſſurance, and further had thereunto bound himſſelfe vnto the Duke by oath, while hee alſo remained Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue with him, promiſing withall to marie his daughter. For this cauſe many thought it the beſt courſe to make the Duke their king, the rather by keeping promiſe with him, not only for that they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:473:19"/> war otherwiſe threatned, &amp; the miſeries co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in flicted for the puniſhment of periury might thereby be auoyded, but alſo for that by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Normandie</hi> vnto the crowne of <hi>England,</hi> vnder ſo mighty a Prince, the realme ſhould bee much ſtrengthned and the common-wealth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched. But <hi>Harold</hi> preuenting further conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen vpon the ſame daie on which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſſed King was put into his graue, hee forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with put the Crowne on his head without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſolemnity. This act did not a little offend the Cleargie, as beeing a breach of the Church her holie ordinance. Wherefore to ſalue that ſore (being not ignorant how hard a thing it is for a Prince newlie aduanced, to hold his authoritie without the opinion at leaſt of vertue and piety) &amp; the better to confirme the ſame, hee left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vndone that might adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; pleaſure the eccleſiaſtical eſtate either for matter of profit or ornament. Further he entertained the noble men with al kinde of curtiſies, eſpecially <hi>Edgar Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee created Earle of Oxford. As for the communalty they were well caſed in their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed taxation &amp; paime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And on thoſe that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in want he beſtowed liberal maintenance. To conclude his affability &amp; curtious ſpeech, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to heare others ſpeake, his indifferency and vpright carriage betweene party and party in matter of controuerſie, made him both beloued &amp; feared: the beſt ſupporters of authority. When
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:473:20"/> the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> had inteligence of the death of the King, &amp; what had followed thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>England,</hi> he ſeemed not ſo much trobled with the loſſe of his Kinſman, as to thinke that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſhould looſe a Kingdom, wherof his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hopes had already taken ful poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he preſently ſent ouer ſome of his Counſell, on ambaſſage to <hi>Harold,</hi> to put him in minde of his former promiſe, and accordingly to demand the Crowne as of right it appertained to him. Wherevnto after ſome deliberation they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued anſwer. <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, for the promiſe made by the late deceaſſed King, it was of no force ſeeing it reſted not in his powre alone, to diſpoſe of the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> at his pleaſure, neyther though the King might haue done it, was hee bound to yeeld therevnto becauſe he came to the Crowne not by right of ſucceſſion, but by free election. And as concerning his owne promiſe and oath, hee was vnwillinglie in the time of captiuitie drawne therevnto by force, fraud, and feare of perpetuall impriſonment, made to the preiudice or the Realme, and the authotitie of the three eſtates of the ſame, and therefore they were to bee reputed voide and of no validitie, which hee neither ought to performe, neither (though he would) had he any warrant thereto, ſeeing the deceaſſed King was not acquainted therewith, nor yet had his ſubiects conſent vnto it. Finally that the Duke had no reaſon to make

The Duke was not a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with this anſwer, eſteeming it a bare and badde excuſe wherewith to colour his periurie. Therfore hee forth-with ſent ouer againe other Ambaſſadors more ſeriouſly to admoniſh him, what conſcience hee ought to make of an oath, how odious the breach thereof was both to God and man, not onely deſeruing puniſhment in this life, diſhonor &amp; endleſſe infamie, but withall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of body and ſoule in the world to come. <hi>Harold</hi> now vnderſtanding that the Dukes daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was dead, who before was affianced vnto him vpon his former promiſe and oath, and was the very foundation and ground-work for the ſame: theſe men were entertained with leſſe curteſy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former, neither could they get other anſwer of him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before he had made. Now did al things tend to open war. The Nauy was forth-with fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of all complements pertaining there-to: Souldiers were muſtered, watch and ward ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longſt the ſea-coaſt, eſpecially in places of moſt aduantage for the enemies landing, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer elſe was thought commodious either for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or offence was with all ſpeede put in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Firſt of al, <hi>Toſty</hi> the Kings brother (beſides al mens expectation) gaue the on-ſet. This Man
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:473:21"/> being ambitiouſly minded, ſometimes gouerned in great authoritie ouer the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> but abuſing his place by too much ſeuerity ouer his inferiors, extreame arrogancie and pride towards his ſoueraigne, and malice and enuie at the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his owne Brothers, he was deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly baniſhed by King <hi>Edward,</hi> and liued after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes in <hi>France. Toſtie,</hi> at the inſtigation of <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and of the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi> as it was thought (both hauing married <hi>Baldwines</hi> daughters) began nowe to purſue his Brother with open warre, whom long before he had deadly hated in his heart. His Nauie conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of ſome threeſcore ſaile, and loaſed from the Coaſt of <hi>Flanders</hi> wherewith arriuing at the Wight, hee ouer-ran and waſted the Ile, paſſing from thence he annoyed the Kentiſh Coaſt, but being terrified with the approch of the Kings Nauie, leauing thoſe parts, he directed his courſe to the Coaſt of Lincolne-ſhire, where at his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he was repulſed by <hi>Edwine</hi> and <hi>Morcar,</hi> and forced to retire into <hi>Scotland,</hi> there to repaire &amp; augment his forces. Herevpon it was doubted, that the Realme ſhould bee aſſailed on that ſide from thence, and on the other out off <hi>Normandy.</hi> The terror hereof made the deeper impreſſion, by reaſon of a Comet which appearing in feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner, for the ſpace of little leſſe then a weeke together, diſpoſed mens mindes (as in ſo trobleſome a time it commeth often to paſſe)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:473:21"/> to an opinion and expectation of ſome grieuous euent portended thereby. But <hi>Harold</hi> hauing a vigilant eye to his buſines on euery ſide, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened the coaſts all along the North parts with ſufficient defence, though not much doubting any inuaſion that way, becauſe <hi>Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scotts</hi> had his hands full at home thorough the ſedition of his owne ſubiects. In the meane time the Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> ſet all his wits on worke which way hee might beſt effect his indeauors. Often he debated the matter with his beſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Captaines whom he found alwayes verie forward in the enterprize for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The onely difficultie reſted, by what meanes money might be gotten ſufficient for diſcharge of ſo coſtly a iourney. For when at a publike aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the States called together for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, a ſubſidie was demanded, anſwer was made, that the countrie was ſo much inpoueriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the laſt warre with <hi>France,</hi> that if a newe ſhould ariſe, it would bee hardly prouided to make defence for it ſelfe, for the which, it ſtood them vpon much more to make prouiſion, then neglecting the ſame, to hazard all for the getting of that, which if they got at all, they looked to come by at ſo deare a rate. And though the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell were iuſt, yet the warre was not ſo neceſſary as dangerous. Finally that the <hi>Normans</hi> were not bound to follow their Duke into any foraine ſeruice. Thus by no meanes could they bee now
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:473:22"/> perſwaded to part with any thing, although <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Fitzoſbert</hi> (a man highly eſteemed both of Prince and people) labored the matter as much as poſſibly he could, and thereby to drawe on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by his example, hee franckly offred at his owne charge to furniſh out forty ſhips towards this enterprice. The Duke ſeeing hee could not preuaile this way, tried what might be gotten by priuate intreaty, for the richeſt men in all the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try being come before him, he called ech one a part from the reſt, and ſo much preuailed by his faire words &amp; curtious behauiour, that as if they had contended who ſhould giue moſt, euery one offred very liberally, ſo that after the perticuler I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems were caſt vp, &amp; accounted, the totall ſumme far exceeded the Dukes expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Hauing thus obtained ſo large a contribution of his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, he further attempted what aide might bee gotten of the Princes his allies &amp; neighbors, the Earles of <hi>Aniou, Poictou, Le-Main,</hi> and <hi>Bollogne,</hi> to whom he promiſed vpon his good ſucceſſe great preferments in <hi>England.</hi> Alſo he ſolicited <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> king offring, that if he would aſſiſt him in the conqueſt of this Land, to bind himſelfe by oth, to hold the crowne of him, as of his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord &amp; maiſter. But becauſe it ſeemed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious to <hi>France</hi> that the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy,</hi> which then ſtood but in ſlender awe of the king, ſhould be ſtrengthed by the addition of <hi>England</hi> (for the ouer great powre of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:473:22"/> nation is held amongſt Princes a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous point) <hi>Philip</hi> was ſo farre off from yeelding him any aide therin, as that he did what he could to diſſwade him from it. Neuertheleſſe the Duke would not by any means be remoued from that he had alreadie ſo farre forth vndertaken, but was the more forward being now alſo backed &amp; inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the enterpoſed authority of <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who now firſt began to vſurpe a Soueraignty and command ouer Princes. For his Holineſſe ratifying the Dukes intereſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with a hallowed banner, as an aſſured token of happy ſucceſſe, wherfore hauing gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his whole powre in redineſſe at S. <hi>Valeries</hi> (a little towne ſcituat at the entry of the riuer <hi>Some</hi>) the Nauie attended a faire winde, which becauſe they could not haue ſo ſone as they would, the <hi>Normans</hi> weried the poore Saint (<hi>Patron</hi> of that place) with the multitude of vowes and did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load him with their continuall offerings. <hi>Harold,</hi> who had all this while, with his people waited in vaine on the enemies landing, determined with himſelfe to diſmiſſe his army, and to diſſolue his nauy for that time, as well becauſe his prouiſion of corne fayled, as alſo hauing receaued letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſignifying that the duke purpoſed to ſtir no further that yeare, which hee the rather beleeued, becauſe winter approaching (for the ſun was returned to his latter equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all period) the ſeaſon was vnfit for nauigation.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:473:23"/>
            <p>But his armie was no ſooner diſmiſſed, but he was conſtrained, by an vnexſpected occaſion, to gather together his diſpearſed forces. For <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold Harfager</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> playing the Pirat alongſt the Northen coaſts, had alredy ſeized on the iles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> intiſed thereunto by <hi>Toſty,</hi> who had put him in hope of attayning the Crowne, and were together entred the riuer of <hi>Tine</hi> with ſome few leſſe then fiue hundred ſmale veſſels. There forces thus vnited, they tooke ſpoile of the Countries adioyning, paſſing from thence alongſt the coaſt of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> till they entred the Riuer of <hi>Humber,</hi> making what ſpoyle they could on ether ſide. In the meane time the two Erles <hi>Edwine</hi> and <hi>Morcar</hi> gathering vp certaine diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred troopes, ſuch as the Country vpon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine could afford, made head againſt them, but being repulſed by the <hi>Noruegians,</hi> many of them together with there captaines ſaued them ſelues by flight, but the greater mumber vnaduiſedly ruſhing into the Riuer of <hi>Ouſe</hi> (thereby hoping to haue eſcaped) periſhed in the water. After this blowe, they prepared to beſiedg <hi>Yorke,</hi> whether being come ſooner then was looked, the Cittie was ſurrendred and hoſtages deliuered on both ſides. Within fewe dayes, <hi>Harold</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in his paſſage gathered what forces he could commeth to <hi>Yorke,</hi> from whence purſuing the <hi>Noruegians,</hi> he found them very ſtrongly incam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, hauing on their backes the maine Ocean, on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:473:23"/> their leaft hand the riuer of <hi>Humber,</hi> where their ſhips lay at Ancre, and vpon the right hand and a front they were pretily defended by the riuer <hi>Derwine.</hi> All this not-with-ſtanding <hi>Harold</hi> aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them very couragiouſly. The fight began vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bridge whereon, it is ſaid, that a <hi>Norue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> alone, a long time kept back the whole armie of the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> from paſſing ouer, vntill he was ſtroken thorow with a Dart. The armies being ioyned, the fight continued a good while, with doubtfull victory on either ſide, but in the end the <hi>Noruegian</hi> hoaſt was wholy defeated, of whom the greater number together with their King and his partaker <hi>Toſtie,</hi> were ſlaine in the battaile. This victory brought alſo with it a rich bootie, for beſides much treaſure, they left behind them all their ſhips, ſauing ſome twentie of the worſt, which were beſtowed on <hi>Paul</hi> Earle of the Iles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> and on <hi>Oliue</hi> ſonne to the <hi>Norue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> King, therein to carry home their maimed ſouldiers, hauing firſt taken an oath that from thence forth they ſhould neuer moleſt this land againe. Fortune thus ſmiling on our <hi>Harold,</hi> made him eſteeme very highly of himſelfe: for thinking that the <hi>Normans</hi> would now ſtand in feare of his mightineſſe, hee began to make leſſe account of his ſouldiers, not reſpecting how ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly hee rewarded them for their late good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, but reſeruing to himſelfe, and ſome fewe of his fauorites, the whole wealth attained by this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:473:24"/> victory, he became odious to his owne ſubiects. The North parts being thus diſtempered by this inuaſion from <hi>Norway,</hi> he wholy applied himſelfe to ſet all things there in good order and ſafetie againe. In the meane time the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> taking the offered oportunity, about the ende of September hoiſed vp his ſailes and with a fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable winde landed his whole army at<note n="*" place="margin">Pemſey.</note> 
               <hi>Peuenſie</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> cauſing his ſhips to be ſet on fier, thereby taking from his ſouldiers all hope of ſauing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by flight. Hauing builded here ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, he marched from thence alongſt the ſea coaſt to <hi>Haſtings,</hi> where alſo hee rayſed an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fortreſſe, and furniſhed them both with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſtrength for their defence. Here be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the cauſes mouing him to vndertake this enterpriſe, namely, to bee reuenged on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage committed vpon his Couſin <hi>Alfred,</hi> whom togither with diuerſe <hi>Normans, Godwine,</hi> Father to <hi>Harold</hi> had wickedly murthered. To take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge on <hi>Harold</hi> himſelfe as well for cauſing <hi>Robert</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> to be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Realme in the daies of King <hi>Edward,</hi> as alſo for vniuſtlie detayning from him the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of England, contrary to his faithfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and oth. But in any caſe hee ſtrictly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badde his Souldiers to inflict anie outragious calamities vpon the countrie people: knowledge heereof was preſently brought to king <hi>Harold,</hi> who therevpon without further deliberation, to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:473:24"/> the end hee might the more ſpeedily incounter the <hi>Normans,</hi> diſpatched his poſtes into all the partes of the Realme, intreating his ſubiects to perſeuer in their loyaltie and duetifull obedience vnto him, and hauing gathered what powre by al poſſible means hee could, by long iorneyes hee came in fewe daies to <hi>London.</hi> Hither the Duke ſent his ambaſſador, who demanding reſignation of the kingdom vnto his maiſter, very hardly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped with life, ſo much was <hi>Harold</hi> inraged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. For by his late victory ouer the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegians</hi> he was ſo encoraged, that nothing could now appall &amp; daunt him. He returned the Duke anſwere, that vnleſſe he would forth-with draw homewards, it ſhould be worſſe for him. But the Duke in modeſty replied, and in curtious manner diſmiſſed the meſſenger. <hi>Harold</hi> in the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſtering his men at <hi>London,</hi> found that ſince the late conflict with the <hi>Norwegians,</hi> his forces were ſhrewdly weakned, neuertheles by reaſon of the repaire of the Nobility and others (whome the loue of their country brought thither to the defence of the ſame, againſt a danger of like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice to them all) a great army was from thence ſpeedily conducted by himſelfe into <hi>Suſsex,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer perſwaſion, his Mother could vſe to the contrary notwithſtanding and with an inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble corrag he encamped his hoaſt in a faire plaine with in leſſe then ſeauen miles of the enemy. The Duke approaching ſent forth his eſpiales as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:473:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> the other did, to giue intelligence one of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers demeaner. They of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> part (either of ignorance or of purpoſe to terrifie their king) exceedingly extolled &amp; preferred the Dukes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, both for number, furniture, orderlie diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and conduction of the ſame. In ſo much as <hi>Githe</hi> the Kings brother (an expert warriour) holding it not conuenient to hazard the looſing of all vpon the ſucceſſe of one bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, aduiſed the King not to be ouer forward, ſhewing him how vnconſtant fortune vſeth to ſhew her ſelfe in martiall aduentures, fauoring thoſe for the more part that are of leaſt deſart. That an aduiſed delaie was reputed a principall point of military diſcipline. That if he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to reſerue the Crowne to the vſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe of the Duke (as it was iuſtified) hee then held it fit, he ſhould retire his perſon, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that without a good conſcience no force or powre whatſoeuer ſhould ſtand him in ſteed. That God himſelfe would take reuenge vpon faith-breakers. That nothing would more diſmay the enemy, then to be ſet vpon ſtill afreſh with new ſupplie, offring that if he would commit to him the aduenture of that battile, he would not faile to performe the part both of a faithfull brother, and of a reſolute Captaine. That hee maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his quarrell vpon warrant of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (as far as he knewe) ſhould haue more happy ſucceſſe againſt the <hi>Normans,</hi> or not vnhappily
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:473:25"/> giue his life for the loue he bare to his King &amp; Country. <hi>Harold</hi> was much offended hereat, as eſteeming it a ſpeech ouermuch ſauouring of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and reproch to his perſon. For as he would take in good part whatſoeuer euent followed the battell, ſo could he not indure in any ſort to bee taxed of want of courage. Wherefore as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commendation giuen to the behauiour of his aduerſaries, he lightly regarded that report, neither (as he tooke it) could it be without great diſhonor to his former renowne, that beeing come to the repulſe of the laſt danger which hee was like to fall into, hee ſhould now ſhrinke and fearefully with-drawe himſelfe. In this manner doth fatall deſtinies bewitch their ſenſes, whom they meane to bring to deſtruction. While theſe things were thus debated, Duke <hi>William</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the care he had to auoid the effuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of much Chriſtian bloud, (which in that quarrell was likely to bee ſhed) before any particular reſpect of aduantage to himſelfe, ſent a Munke to <hi>Harold</hi> with this meſſage: Either to ſurrender vnto him the Crowne and Scepter of <hi>England,</hi> or elſe to acknowledge thence-forth to hold them vnder him, as in his right. But if the title muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be tryed by Armes, then to haue it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by ſingle Combat betweene themſelues. If none of theſe offers would be accepted, then to commit the cauſe to the hearing and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as an indifferent
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:473:26"/> Iudge and vmpire betweene them. <hi>Harold</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that it was not in his powre to yeald to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe offers, but hee referred the diſciding of this waightie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie to the final ſentence and decree of the ſupreame and celeſtiall Iudge, and moderator of all humaine actions. That on the next morning, beeing the foureteenth day of October, hee would not faile to giue him battell, vainely imagining to haue the better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe becauſe it was his birth-day. The <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> ſpent all the next night in exceſſiue riot, but the <hi>Normans</hi> contrariwiſe paſſing the ſame without any miſdemeanor gaue themſelues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to holſome meditations and exerciſes of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At the apearance of day, euery man prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe to the fight. On the <hi>Engliſh</hi> part, the <hi>Kentiſhmen</hi> were placed in the front of the battell (to whom that place pertained by an ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome) with their Halberds in their handes. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi> with his Brother, the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and the reſt of his army made vp the whole Battel. On the other ſide <hi>Roger Mongomery</hi> &amp; <hi>William Fitzoſbert,</hi> had the leading of the Vangard which conſiſted of horſemen of <hi>Aniou,</hi> &amp; of the contries of <hi>Perch, Le-Maine</hi> and <hi>Britaine,</hi> of whom a great number ſerued vnder the <hi>Britaine Fergent.</hi> The midle bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile (who were <hi>Germaines</hi> &amp; <hi>Pictoines</hi> was condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <hi>Galfred Martell,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Germaine.</hi> The Duke himſelfe managed the rereward, wherin was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſtrength of his nation &amp; the flowre of his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:473:26"/> Nobilitie. Theſe three battells were thorow out enter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ined with the <hi>Norman</hi> Archers. The <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> being thus marſhalled; ſounding the alaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without any confuſed noiſe, aduanced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues forward, &amp; withall from euery ranck mounting their Arrowes in the ayre, they fell on the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen</hi> as thicke as haileſtones, wherat they were not a little diſmaide hauing neuer before beene acquainted with ſuch kind of weapons, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whoſe annoyance no man was free, euen in the middeſt of their owne forces. This ſtorme (vnlooked for) beeing blowne ouer, the <hi>Normans</hi> forth-with ran fiercely vpon the foreward of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Armie, who reſoluing rather to die where they ſtood the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue ground, keeping themſelues cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, repulſed the enemie with no ſmall loſſe and diſadua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage vnto him. Neuertheles he forthwith gaue a freſh aſſalt, whereat, with terrible outcries both armies ruſhed one vpon the other. Beeing now coped together at hand blowes, the fight co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued very hotlie for a good ſeaſon, but the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen</hi> ſtill keeping their aray (as if they had bin linked one to another) reſiſted the others malice. The <hi>Norma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> hauing receiued many wounds were withal ready to giue back, had not the Duke (plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng the part no leſſe of a Souldior then of a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Captain) as much by example as by directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> incoraged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſtand to it manfully. The fight thus ſtill maintained on either ſide, the <hi>Norman</hi> horſemen, with all poſſible force charged vpon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:473:27"/> them, and withall powring out, a new tempeſt of their airy weapons, with the violent fall of their arrowes, did ſeeme euen to beate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> down to the ground. But the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> without any diſorder abide this brunt alſo. For <hi>Harold</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the part of a moſt valiant Captaine, was ſtill at hand, where occaſion required to inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his men. Neither came the Duke behinde him in that reſpect, who hauing now had his horſe twice ſlaine vnder him, and perceauing that by the only vertue of his powre hee ſhould not preuaile; aſſaied what might be done by ſlight &amp; policy. Wherefore cauſing the trumpets to ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a retreate, the <hi>Normans</hi> without breking their array, did retire and giue backe. The <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> miſtaking their meaning, thought the victory now their owne, and withall, (no reſpect had of keeping order) they purſued them more egarlie then warily, which the enemy perceauing, &amp; tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exſpected aduantage, vpon a ſudden tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe, and redily reducing his troopes into good order, ſet vpon them a freſh &amp; made a great ſlaughter of them. Many were beaten downe while they were thinking whether it were better to fight or to flie. But the greater number keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſtand cloſe togither on the heigth of a hill, and incoraging one the other not to ſhrinke, manfully fought it out a long time, as though they had purpoſely choſen that place to giue the more honor vnto their deaths. In the end <hi>Harold</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:473:27"/> being ſhot into the head with an arrow, togither with <hi>Githe</hi> his brother, yeelded vp their fainting ſpirits. <hi>Edwine</hi> and <hi>Morcar</hi> with ſome fewe moe eſcaping by flight, gaue place to time &amp; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence, after the fight had continewed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt appearance of daylight vnto the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of the ſame. In this battaile were ſlaine of <hi>Normans</hi> fewe leſſe then ſixe thouſand, but of the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> a farre greater number. The Duke hauing obtained this notable victory had no ſmall cauſe to reioyce thereat: neuertheleſſe hee attrbuted the honour and glory thereof to the giuer of all happineſſe, and by publique thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing acknowledged the ſame.

And further, taking from the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> their lands and poſſeſſions, hee beſtowed them on his followers and partakers in his conqueſt, at his owne will and pleaſure. Herevpon (as alſo by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other extremities dayly offered more and more, to all degrees and eſtates,) the great men eſpecially, who (thorow the greatneſſe of their mindes) could worſt indure ſo many indignities, conuaied them-ſelues out of the realme, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one country, ſome into another, hoping to finde ſuch fauour with forraigne Princes, as with their helpe they might happily one day finde meanes to bee reſtored againe to their former eſtates and dignities in their natiue Countrie.</p>

            <p>Amongſt theſe <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> (whom this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe concerned more then any of the reſt) pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to haue ſailed into <hi>Germanie</hi> to his friends and alliance there, together with his mother and two ſiſters, was by contrary windes (as the Lord would haue it) driuen into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they were curteouſly intertained of <hi>Malcolme</hi> (ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Cammore</hi>) the King of that Countrie, the rather becauſe they were of the bloud and linage of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, by whoſe eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes he had beene eſtabliſhed in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Shortly after in reſpect (no doubt) of the poſſibilitie wherein ſhee ſtood to come by the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> after her brother, King <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colme</hi> tooke to wife the Lady <hi>Marguerit,</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſiſter. This marriage was ſolemnized about Eaſter next following, in the yeare 1067. King <hi>William</hi> hearing what had paſſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and fearing leſt this alliance might worke him ſome diſpleaſure (for <hi>Edgar</hi> had many well-willers in <hi>England</hi>) forth-with ſent an Harold of Armes to King <hi>Malcolme</hi> for the deliuery of him, which if it would not be granted, then he ſhould denounce open warre againſt him. Anſwer was here-unto made, that hee held it a very vniuſt thing, yea a very wicked part for him to deliuer <hi>Edgar</hi> into his hands, that onely for feare of the loſſe of his life was forced to flie out off <hi>England,</hi> beeing of that innocent carriage and demeanor towards the King his Maiſter, that euen his greateſt

Further that he was now bound (beſides the reſpect of ordinary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie in this caſe) by more ſtraight bands of neere alliance, to tender his eſtate. So as King <hi>Malcome</hi> was no whit terrified with theſe threats, ſtill intertaining <hi>Edgar</hi> his friends, that dayly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by whom King <hi>Malcome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incouraged, tooke the oportunitie that was offered. For whileſt King <hi>William</hi> was occupied in purſuing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebels, he with his armie entred into <hi>England,</hi> waſting and ſpoiling the countries of <hi>Theiſdale</hi> and <hi>Cleueland,</hi> and the lands of Saint <hi>Cutbert,</hi> with diuers other in thoſe parts. For the ſuppreſſing of whom, King <hi>William</hi> ſent <hi>Goſpatrike,</hi> whom he had lately before made Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> in the place of <hi>Syward,</hi> that tooke part againſt him with the <hi>Scottes</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen</hi> their adherents. Entring into thoſe parts, he made the like ſpoile, as was before made by the <hi>Scottes,</hi> ſo as thoſe countries were grieuouſlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on both ſides.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:473:32"/> not diſpoſed to abide his approach, fled vnto the Mountaines; wherefore giuing them ouer, hee turned his forces into <hi>Lothiane,</hi> where he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that king <hi>Malcome</hi> was incamped with all his whole powre, purpoſing to make a conqueſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo. But when theſe two puiſſant ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were euen ready to aſſaile one the other, the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> king diſtruſting his ſtrength, and fearing the fortune of the Conqueror, ſent an Harrald of Armes to enter into treatie of a firme peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two Nations, wherevnto king <hi>William</hi> was drawne at the length, on theſe conditions.

               </hi> which then tooke part with <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> againſt him. Further to auoide all occaſion of quarrell that happily might afterwards ariſe about the limits &amp; bounds of the two kingdoms, it was agreed vpon, that a croſſe of ſtone ſhould be erected in <hi>Steenmore</hi> (which tooke that name of the nature of the ſoile, which was very ſtonie) bearing the Armes and Image of the king of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on the South-ſide thereof, and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-ſide the armes and Image likewiſe of the king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which while it ſtood for many yeares after was called the croſſe of the kings. Thus were they accorded, and thence-forth continued in friendſhip while they liued together. King <hi>William</hi> in his returne tooke the Earledome of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> from <hi>Goſpatricke</hi> (on whom he had lately

            <p>Herof had <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> king no good liking, being vnwilling that ſo mighty a Prince, and ſo neare a neighbour ſhould haue ſuch foot-hold with in his dominions; for in the right of his wife Queene <hi>Elioner</hi> (who had beene before deuorſed from <hi>Lewis</hi>) hee had attained the poſſeſſion of the Duchy of <hi>Aquitane</hi> and the Earle-dome of <hi>Poitou,</hi> by his mother the Empreſſe he inioyed the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> &amp; in his Fathers right hee ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed (not without ſome hard meaſure, towards his brother <hi>Geffrey</hi> vnto whom their Father by his laſt Teſtament had giuen the ſame) vpon the Earledomes of <hi>Aniou, Touraigne,</hi> and <hi>Maine.</hi> Neuertheleſſe hee ſubtilely couered his malice vnder pretext of diſſembled alliance, leaſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſhould haue had leſſe aduantage of him.

            <p>At this meeting, king <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> his Brother, together, with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords, tooke an oathe to continue true to the king of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to abide in due obedience vnder him and his lawes, beeing now to leaue them for a ſeaſon: for hee was ſo farre paſſed on his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towards the Holy-land, as it was then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And the more firmely to binde the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> king by his liberalitie to the obſeruance of this othe, hee there reſtored vnto him all the other three Caſtles at <hi>Berwicke, Rockesbrough</hi> and <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge,</hi> and withall that parte of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which king <hi>Henrie</hi> his Father had taken from him when hee was his priſoner.

But when King <hi>William</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the King of <hi>England</hi> his returne home, hee together with Earle <hi>Dauid</hi> his brother (who a little before was returned into <hi>Scotland</hi>) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie repayred to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intertained with all kinde of courteſies, in token of the ioye that hee had vnfainedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for the King of <hi>England</hi> his ſafe returne thorow ſo many great dangers, hee preſented him with two thouſand markes, towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of his libertie. To gratifie this his kindneſſe, King <hi>Richard</hi> granted to him by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Charter, and to his heires kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> for euer, that when-ſo-euer hee or any of them ſhould by ſommons repaire into <hi>England</hi> vnto the Court, the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> and the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> for the time beeing, ſhould receaue him at the water of <hi>Tweede,</hi> and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:473:43"/> ſafely conduct him to the water of <hi>Theeſe,</hi> where the Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the Sheriffe of the Shire ſhould receiue him of them, and from thence to attend him to the border of the next ſhire, and in this manner to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from ſhire to ſhire, by Prelates and She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes, vntill hee came to the Court, and an honourable allowance was made him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to defray ſuch expences, as hee and his traine were put vnto, during their abode in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While king <hi>William</hi> remained at the Court, king <hi>Richard</hi> (thereby to put away as it were the reproche of his late captiuitie) cauſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee crowned againe, whereat (for the more honour of that ſolemnitie) it pleaſed king <hi>William</hi> to carie one of the three Swords of eſtate before the King, accompanied on his right hand with <hi>Hamling</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> and on the other with <hi>Ranulphe</hi> Earle of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in manner as his Brother Earle Dauid had done before, at the Kings firſt Coronation, ſaue that the firſt place was then giuen to Earle <hi>Iohn</hi> his Brother. This feaſt was kept at <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> on the ſeauenteenth day of Aprill, Anno 1194. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1194"/> king <hi>William</hi> beeing now at the point to depart homewards offered the king fifteene thouſand markes for the whole country of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> in manner as Prince <hi>Henry</hi> his father (who neuer came to the crowne) held the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:473:44"/>
            <p>The king yeelded here vnto, ſo as the Caſtles were excepted, but ſtill hee importuned him for them alſo. The King anſwered, that at his returne againe (for now he was ready to paſſe into <hi>Normandie</hi>) hee ſhould finde him willing to ſatisfie him in any reaſonable ſort. But it was king <hi>Richardes</hi> happe after many victories ouer the <hi>French</hi> Nation during his aboade on that ſide the Sea for the ſpace of fowre yeares, in the end to die of a wound which hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the ſiege of the Caſtle of <hi>Chalme</hi> by an inuenomed Dart, as he was viewing where he might beſt vndermine the ſame. Thus ended king <hi>Richard,</hi> after hee had raigned nine yeares and as many months: Where-vpon <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of <hi>Mortaigne</hi> his Brother beeing then alſo on that ſide the Sea, thorough the induſtrie of the Queene his Mother, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and other his fauourites in <hi>England,</hi> was forth-with proclaimed king. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1199"/> And to make all the more ſure on their ſide (for they were very iealous ouer his Nephew young <hi>Arthure</hi> Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> whoſe right to the Crowne was by manie, eſpecially the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the others) they promiſed king <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> to obtaine of king <hi>Iohn</hi> at his returne ouer, whatſoeuer hee pretended title vnto, within the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dominions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scotiſh</hi> king beeing thus put in hope to attaine vnto his deſire, in token of his good
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:473:44"/> liking and allowance of their proceedings in the behalfe of king <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſent the Biſhop of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> to his coronation, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and inſtructions to moue and proſecute his demand of reſtitution of thoſe Landes hee claymed, promiſing withall to abſtaine from all forcible inuaſion for the ſpace of fortie dayes, ſo as within that tearme he might haue a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute anſwer from the king concerning the ſame. Here unto King <hi>Iohn</hi> made anſwer, that if his couſin the king of <hi>Scots</hi> would come vnto him, hee ſhould haue at his handes whatſoeuer in reaſon hee could demand. For the place of their meeting, <hi>Notingham</hi> was firſt appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, afterwardes <hi>Yorke,</hi> but king <hi>William</hi> vpon ſome occaſion, fayling to come to eyther of theſe two places, king <hi>Iohn</hi> paſſed ouer into <hi>Normandie,</hi> where hauing appeaſed ſome broiles ſtirred vp by the <hi>French</hi> king in the behalfe of young <hi>Arthure,</hi> at his returne hee ſent an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Ambaſſage into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct king <hi>William</hi> into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two kings mett at <hi>Lincolne</hi> on the one and twenteth daye of Nouember in the ſecond yeare of the raigne of king <hi>Iohn,</hi> to whome the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> king did there homage and fealtie: which ſeruices beeing performed king <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> required reſtitution of <hi>Northumberland, Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmerland,</hi> which he claimed as his right and lawfull inheritance; after
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:473:45"/> much parlance there about; king <hi>Iohn</hi> craued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to conſider further of the matter till the Feaſt of Penticoſt next following, where-vnto the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> king conſenting, the Aſſemblie brak vp, and king <hi>William</hi> was attended backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by thoſe that brought him thither.</p>
            <p>But king <hi>Iohn,</hi> eyther beeing not diſpoſed, or not at leiſure to hold the appointed time, ſent Ambaſſadors into <hi>Scotland</hi> to intreat king <hi>William</hi> to giue him further daye, to returne him anſwer touching his former demand. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the other yeelding, gaue him Michel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſe next according to his deſire. All this notwithſtanding I doe not finde in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of eyther Nation, that king <hi>Iohn</hi> did at any time after inlarge his poſſeſſions within the Realme of <hi>England.</hi> After this ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe aroſe betweene them about the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a fortification, which the king of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had built ouer againſt <hi>Berwicke,</hi> vppon which occaſion, as alſo by reaſon that while the Realme ſtood in the damnable eſtate, as the world then beleeued, of the Popes terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble curſe, diuerſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobilitie and others forſooke their naturall king, and for conſcience ſake fledd into <hi>Scotland</hi> (ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had the Papacie ouer mens conſciences in thoſe dayes.)</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iohn</hi> not contented there-with, hauing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:473:45"/> gathered an Armie, and there-with approching the borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> hee was incountred at <hi>Norham</hi> with Ambaſſadors from King <hi>William,</hi> (who then being about the age of threeſcore &amp; ten yeares, was vnfit to fight. At this meeting by mediation of friends a finall peace was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and for the more aſſurance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> King deliuered his two Daughters <hi>Iſabell</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> into the cuſtodie of king <hi>Iohn</hi> to bee beſtowed in marriage, when they came to ripe age vpon his two Sonnes. <hi>Buchanan</hi> ſaith that it was agreed vpon at this time, that thence-forth the kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould no more in their owne perſons doe homage to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> but thoſe ſeruices ſhould only be performed by their eldeſt ſons, &amp; for no other then for thoſe lands and poſſeſſions which they held within the Realme of <hi>England.</hi> But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appeareth nothing amongſt our own writers. About foure or fiue yeares after this agreement king <hi>William</hi> departed out off this life, whom <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> his ſonne by the Lady <hi>Ermengard</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, ſucceeded, beeing ſixteene yeares of age, anſwerable to the terme that king <hi>Iohn</hi> had then raigned, of whom in the meane ſeaſon Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> receiued the Order of knight-hoode at <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time, vpon complaint made by the yong Prince (which title hee had newely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by creation of his Father) that diuerſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:473:46"/> rebellious perſons had preſumed vpon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie of the Father and Sonne, by reaſon of the ouer old age of the one, and vnripe age of the other, to oppoſe themſelues againſt their gouernement, vnder the leading of one <hi>Gothred.</hi> King <hi>Iohn</hi> eyther in perſon (as ſome write) or rather in powre, (as I take it) accompanying the young Prince, did not onely ſafe conduct him home, but forthwith ioyning with certaine forces of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they together incountred the enemies in a ſet battell, gaue them the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, tooke their chiefe Captaine priſoner, and according to his deſerts made him ſhorter by the head. Notwithſtanding all this kindneſſe yet ſo freſh in memory that it could not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, immediatly vpon Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> his comming to the Crowne in the yeare of our Lord 1214 his youth eaſilie neglected the due regard he ſhould haue had of king <hi>Iohn</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1214"/> Thus it fell out: amongſt others then in fauour with this young king, none was ſo much accounted of as a Nobleman of <hi>England,</hi> (yet by birth a <hi>Scotiſhman</hi>) one <hi>Euſtace de veſcie,</hi> that had married one of his ſiſters. This Gentleman together with <hi>Robert Fitzwalter,</hi> and <hi>Stephen Ridell</hi> had a little before conſpired the death of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who hauing knowledge thereof ſought vnderhand to apprehend them, but they diſtruſting the matter were glad to flie the Realme, <hi>Euſtace</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the other two
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:473:46"/> into <hi>France.</hi> Theſe men did afterwards ſo labour the two Kings of thoſe Nations, that King <hi>Alexander</hi> (notwith-ſtanding the Pope was then appeaſed) was perſwaded to take part with <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> to whome the Barrons of <hi>England</hi> had diſloyallye bound themſelues by oath to receiue and ſerue him, as their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie elected Prince and Soueraigne, reiecting their due allegiance to king <hi>Iohn</hi> their Liege and naturall king.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scotiſhmen</hi> hauing entred into <hi>England</hi> with a great Armie, tooke the Caſtle of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> waſted and harrowed the countrie with all extremitie.

               <hi>Lewis</hi> within fewe months after followed with a new ſupplie, vnto
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:473:47"/> whoſe obedience all the Caſtles, Townes and Fortreſſes in the South-parts of the realme were ſubdued, (the Caſtels of <hi>Douer</hi> and <hi>Windſore</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted. Neither was the North part of the realme free from theſe troubles: for <hi>Robert de Roſſe, Peter de Brocis,</hi> &amp; <hi>Richard Percie</hi> had brought the Citie of <hi>Yorke,</hi> with all that Countie, vnder ſubiection to the <hi>French-men,</hi> in manner as <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert de Gaunt</hi> (whome the <hi>Dolphine</hi> had lately made Earle of <hi>Lincolne</hi>) had done there alſo, where the Caſtell onely held out. Thus was the paſſage prepared for the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> armie, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing it ſelfe forwards in Auguſt, about two moneths after the arriuall of the <hi>Dolphine,</hi> firſt ſeized vpon <hi>Northumberland</hi> wholy, (the Caſtels excepted, which were ſo well defended by the Kings party, that the <hi>Scotiſhmen</hi> thought it loſt labour further to aſſaile them at that time,) but keeping their courſe Southward, they came to <hi>London</hi> with-out any reſiſtance or loſſe, ſauing that <hi>Euſtace de Veſcie</hi> (a principall leader amongſt them) was ſlaine with an Arrowe, as he roade in the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Kings companie to view, where to make an aſſault to the Caſtle of <hi>Barnard</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Haleewarkefolke,</hi> which belonged to <hi>Balliol.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:473:47"/> by <hi>Hugh de Borowgh</hi> and <hi>Gerrard de Scotegame</hi> (the principall men therein) that all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and policie of thoſe two Princes would not ſuffice to winne the ſame, for that was a point of ſuch importance, as that the <hi>French</hi> king had a little before written to his Sonne, that the taking of it was of more auaile vnto his Enterpriſe, then all that hee had gotten in <hi>England</hi> beſides; which cauſed the yong Prince to re-enforce his whole endeauor for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his earneſt deſire. Here king <hi>Alexander</hi> did homage to <hi>Lewis</hi> in manner as hee had done before to king <hi>Iohn,</hi> acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to hold of him as of the lawfull king of <hi>England,</hi> which done he tooke his leaue of <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> and departed homewards, but not ſo quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as hee came thither.

            <p>This ſodaine death of the king (which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the yeare 1216) wrought as ſodaine an alteration in the ſtate of the preſent affayres. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1216"/> For now the barons began better to conſider of the matter, hauing found out both by experience

Wherfore diuerſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobilitie that before had followed that faction, when they vnderſtood that young Prince <hi>Henrie</hi> the kings ſonne was proclaimed lawfull inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and heire aparent to the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> by <hi>William Marſhall</hi> Earle of <hi>Pembroke, Ranulph</hi> Earle of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> &amp; diuers other of the partakers of the deceaſſed King, they beganne one after an other to reuolt from <hi>Lewis,</hi> and to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to their yong King, not aboue nine yeares old. Whereupon after ſome fewe bickrings and incounters by land &amp; ſea, between the one partie and the other, wherein the <hi>French</hi> came ſtill by the worſe, Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> was willing to hearken to peace, which being readilie concluded, he bid farewell to all former his goodly hopes, was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norablie conducted to his ſhips, and tranſported into <hi>France</hi> about a yeare and a halfe from his firſt arriuall in <hi>England.</hi> Thus in ſhort time by the prouidence of God, and the induſtry and loyaltie of ſome principall men of the Nobilitie this nation was deliuered from one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt dangers that euer it was like to fall into. The yong king hauing raigned vnder protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout foure yeares, and euen then purpoſing with himſelfe, after hee ſhould come to mans ſtate (whereunto his notable and rare towardneſſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:473:48"/> did haſten him on) to recouer that which his Father had loſt on the other ſide of the ſea, and withall knowing that the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> nation was of old, too much affected to <hi>France:</hi> that hee might therefore in time preuent all occaſion of trouble on that ſide, it was brought to paſſe at <hi>Yorke,</hi> (where the two kings met by appointment) that king <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould take to wife the Ladie <hi>Ione</hi> ſiſter to king <hi>Henrie,</hi> and further that <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> kings ſiſter ſhould bee giuen in mariage to <hi>Hubert de Borowgh,</hi> a man in excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great fauour for many worthy partes in him; whereof both his Father and hee himſelfe had good tryall, and for thoſe his deſerts king <hi>Henrie</hi> afterwardes created him Earle of <hi>Kent.</hi> The other ſiſter returned againe into <hi>Scotland</hi> vnmaried: theſe two Ladies (as you haue heard before) were committed by their Father to the cuſtodie of king <hi>Iohn.</hi> Theſe mariages were ſolemnized at <hi>Yorke</hi> about Mid-ſummer <hi>Anno.</hi> 1219. Diuerſe couenants were then ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſealed by eyther partie for the more aſſurance of perfect amitie betweene the two Nations, which continued accordingly during the liues of the two kings together, though there were ſome that practiſed what they could (for their owne aduantage) to ſet debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, amongſt whom <hi>Dauid</hi> the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty king of <hi>Wales</hi> hauing receiued an ouerthrow of the <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> and there-vppon flying

This was the more eaſilie compaſſed by reaſon that king <hi>Alexander</hi> had then buried his wife the King of <hi>Englands</hi> ſiſter, and not hauing had any iſſue by her, was againe married to the Lady <hi>Marie,</hi> daughter to <hi>Iugel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> Lord of <hi>Coucie,</hi> a <hi>French-man,</hi> ſo that his former loue and liking towardes <hi>England</hi> was now happilie abated and buried together with his late deceaſſed wife Queene <hi>Ione.</hi> Yet had there then bin an other marriage concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Lord <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> kings eldeſt Sonne, and the Ladie <hi>Margeret</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to king <hi>Henrie</hi> which tooke effect as after ſhall appeare.</p>

            <p>This inſtrument being firſt ſigned and ſealed by king <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelfe, and afterwards by his Nobilitie, was ſent to the King of <hi>England</hi> at Chriſtmaſſe following by the Prior of <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> who had trauelled diligently and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this buſineſſe to the honor and good liking of both parties. And for further confirmation thereof, another writing was ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to the end that this agreement &amp; accord might receiue the more ſtrength fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Holines. This ſolemne league was eſtabliſhed in the yeare of our Lord 1244. Whereupon <hi>Berwick</hi> was reſtored to the king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; <hi>Carliele</hi> (which had bin taken by the <hi>Scots</hi> in the raigne of king <hi>Iohn</hi>) was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reſtored to king <hi>Henry,</hi> &amp; the antient limits of the two kingdomes were bounded out by the Kings croſſe in <hi>Steanmore,</hi> as before at the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement made with the Conqueror. The often intermariages of the one nation with the other (which is the ſureſt band of friendſhip) cauſed this good agreement ſo long between them; for when at any time occaſion of vnkindneſſe was offered by eyther of the two kings, the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of both ſides were ſo lincked one with the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:473:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> other, in ſuch an indiſſoluble vnion, that they would not ſuffer the ſame to breake out into any hoſtilitie. But to conſummate and perfect (as it were) this Gordian knot, within two yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of king <hi>Alexander</hi> the father (which happened in the yeare 1249. his ſonne <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> that ſucceeded (about eight yeares old when his father deceaſed,) was within two yeares after brought to <hi>Yorke,</hi> where King <hi>Henry</hi> on Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas day honoured him with the order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the day following, he gaue him in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage his Daughter, the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the former agreement. At this meeting the young King did homage, in maner as before his father had done, and the League was renewed betweene the two Nations, which continued without any tainte many yeares after. In the meane time, at ſundry meetings of the two kings and their Queenes, much kindneſſe and friendly demeanour paſſed betweene them, to the great reioycing of their ſubiects on both ſides. And as occaſion required, the one would ayde and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the other. For during the troubles betweene King <hi>Henry</hi> and his Barons, king <hi>Alexander</hi> did ſend vnto his ayde fiue thouſand <hi>Scots,</hi> vnder the leading of <hi>Alexander Cumine</hi> and <hi>Robert Bruis,</hi> of whom the greater number was ſlaine in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell of the Father and Sonne againſt their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſubiects. King <hi>Henrie</hi> deceaſing in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and fiftie yeare of his raigne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1272"/> Anno 1272. the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:473:51"/> 
               <hi>Scotiſh</hi> king and Queene came into <hi>England</hi> to the Coronation of king <hi>Edward</hi> his brother in law, where hauing paſſed the time in great iol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and acknowledged his allegiance, hee was honourably attended into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Shortly after his returne thither, Queene <hi>Margaret</hi> his wife deceaſed, and (not long after her death) their two ſonnes <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> dyed alſo, the elder brother hauing lately maryed the daughter of the Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> but left no iſſue behind them. The heauie hand of the Lord ceaſſed not here, but finally inflicted well nere an vtter ruine and deſolation on that kingdome, by taking out of this world (about twelue yeares after) the king himſelfe and his whole progenie, if it bee true that is reported in the Hiſtory of <hi>Scotland,</hi> this calamitie may ſeeme to be prefigured in a prodigious apparition, at the ſecond marriage of king <hi>Alexander:</hi> for as he was leading the Queene his Bride in a dance (according to the manner of ſuch ſolemnities) there appeared to the whole aſſembly the ſimilitude of an humaine Anatomy, following and cloſing vp the traine of the Lords &amp; Ladies that accompanied them. The ſame yeare <hi>viz.</hi> Ann. 1285. king <hi>Alexander</hi> was throwne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off his horſe, and in the fall brake his necke: At his death none remained liuing of his line ſaue onely one infant, the daughter of his daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> Queene of <hi>Norway.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what had hapned in <hi>Scotland,</hi> began to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:473:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> thinke with himſelfe, how exceeding beneficial it would be to both nations, if by any good meanes they might bee vnited and made one monarchie, wherevpon forthwith hee diſpatched Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors thether, to make offer of mariage betweene the yong Lady the heire of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; his ſonne Prince <hi>Edward</hi> heire apparant to the Crowne of <hi>England.</hi> This was no ſooner moued to the lords, but forth-with euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gaue free conſent, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it ſo happy a thing for that kingdome, as nothing could be wiſhed more. The mariage was therefore readily concluded vpon theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. That the <hi>Scotiſhmen</hi> ſhould be gouerned by their owne Lords and lawes, vntill the iſſue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of them ſhould be of age to take the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment vpon them. And if it hapned that no iſſue ſhould thereof ſpring, or ſhould die before ripe age to gouerne: then the kingdom of <hi>Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> ſhould deſcend to the next in bloud to the King laſt deceaſed. Herevpon certaine Noble-men of <hi>Scotland</hi> were preſently ſent into <hi>Norway</hi> for the ſafe conduct of the yong Lady, but it pleaſed not God at that time to giue ſo great a bleſſing to this Iſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for at their returne home they brought heauy newes of her death alſo. The poſteritie of king <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> grand-father to the laſt King, being now extinguiſhed, great diſſention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe about the title &amp; claime to the crowne. The realme by this occaſion being diuided into ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry factions, was in great danger of an vtter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:473:52"/> This controuerſie hauing depended a long time, it was thought fit (ſithence there was none amongſt themſelues of powre &amp; authority to decide a matter of ſo great importance) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſame to the hearing and award of the king of <hi>England,</hi> generally reputed of all the competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors a fit iudge to determine thereof, according as law and equity ſhould direct him. <hi>K. Edward</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to beſtow his trauell to ſo good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and holding himſelfe in a ſort bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, in regard of his right of ſuperioritie ouer that nation, eaſily conſented to their petitions, appointing time &amp; place for the performance of his beſt indeuore to effect their deſire. In the meane time, to the end it might appeare to the world, that he tooke not this office in hand vpon warrant onely of the competitors intreaty, hee cauſed all the ancient Chronicles &amp; records that could be found either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be peruſed, that (if any queſtion therof ſhould ariſe) his pretended intereſt in this action might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently approued. But although this was made ſo manifeſt out of <hi>Marianus</hi> the <hi>Scot, William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury, Roger Houeden, Henry Huntingto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Ralph de Diceto</hi> &amp; others, as none then liuing could gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it: neuertheleſſe the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> writers haue ſince that time much depraued the credit thereof by their bare ſurmiſes. And therefore it ſhall not be impertinent, for the better cleering of this point, before I proceed any further in declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:473:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> matter in hand, to examine how truely one of the beſt learned amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath not long ſince peremptorilie affirmed, that there is nothing to ſhow for the proofe of this pretended Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie ouer the Kings of <hi>Scotland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> praeter</hi> (to vſe his owne words) <hi>veteres fabulas &amp; recentes iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> beſides old farlies &amp; late iniuries. I will not ſtand vpon the teſtimonies fetched from beyond the <hi>Daniſh,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe happilie they may ſeeme not much to the purpoſe, beeing without the compaſſe of the laſt conquerors title, vnder which the ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding kings of <hi>England</hi> muſt make their claime; but let vs ſee what intereſt they can deriue from and vnder him. It is granted that all the kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the conqueſt till that time, haue done homage one after other to the kings of <hi>England,</hi> but not for the Realme of <hi>Scotland</hi> (ſay they) for what then? forſooth for thoſe landes and ſignories which they held of the kings of <hi>England</hi> with in <hi>England.</hi> I would then gladly know when in the ſixt yeare or there-about, of the Conquerors raigne, vpon the concluſion of peace betweene him and king <hi>Malcolme</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for the auoiding of further controuerſie in time to come, the two kingdomes were ſeuered and diuided by markes and bounds, in ſo memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable manner as is before declared: what landes and poſſeſſions did king <hi>Malcolme</hi> then hold pertaining to the Crowne of <hi>England? Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:473:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> (ſaith <hi>Buchanane</hi>) that part of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (ſaith an other) that lyeth betweene the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of <hi>Tweed, Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Staenmore.</hi> well; but whatſoeuer they were, were they not included and contained within thoſe limits and bounds then erected? If not? to what purpoſe ſerued that notorious diuiſion of the two kingdomes? either then haue the <hi>Sootiſh</hi> writers erred in the approbation of that moſt ſolemne particion, or elſe muſt king <hi>Malcome</hi> then doe homage to the Conqueror for his kingdome of <hi>Scotland:</hi> which being granted, then let it bee ſhowed, how and when his heires after him were diſcharged of that ſeruice. Againe how came it to paſſe, that in the ſaid ſixt yeare of the raigne of the Conquerour, <hi>Michael</hi> the elect Biſhop of <hi>Glaſcoe</hi> receaued conſecration at the hands of <hi>Thomas</hi> then the Atchbiſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> as of the primate of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> binding himſelfe by oath to the obedience of that Sea? <hi>Tothade</hi> the Biſhop of Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drowes</hi> did the like, at the commandement of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> the third, king of <hi>Scotland.</hi> If then a Biſhop of <hi>England</hi> had right to this ſupremacie ouer the cleargie of <hi>Scotland,</hi> why ſhould then the like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence bee denied to the kings of <hi>England</hi> at that time, ouer the ſeculer ſtate of the ſame king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Further what moued King <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> together with Earle <hi>Dauid</hi> his brother, and the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Lords then preſent, both temporall and ſpirituall, to acknowledge and ſweare fealtie
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:473:54"/> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond: forſooth, becauſe his ſubiects loued him ſo well, that for his redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they would haue yeelded to any conditions whatſoeuer. As though king <hi>Henry</hi> was ſo vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that contrary to the cuſtome of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he would not accept of any other ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that he ſhould be the firſt king of <hi>Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> that became his vaſſaile, when was it euer heard before that kings haue ſo dealt one with another? as though an vſuall ranſome, yea a very ſmall ſum, (ſeeing he was taken with the loſſe of little bloud or none at all) would haue bin refuſed for his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?

King <hi>Edward</hi> hauing heard the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and anſweres of both parties, cauſed

At the time prefixed he repaired againe into the North-parts, and comming to <hi>Berwicke,</hi> hee called thither the two competitours, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the greater number of the Lords of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to receiue there a finall end of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie. Out of this great aſſembly of the moſt graue and beſt experienced perſonages of both Nations, hee made choiſe of a certaine number, as well <hi>Engliſh</hi> as <hi>Scottiſh,</hi> to whom (as to a Iurie royall, ſworne and admoniſhed to deale vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie) the King gaue full authoritie, to name him, that vnto them appeared, vpon the examination of their ſeuerall titles, and the reſolution of the Lawyers therevpon (which was deliuered vnto them) to haue the better right vnto the crowne of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Theſe men being put a part by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and hauing examined, conſidered, and ſufficiently debated, the prooues, allegations, and whatſoeuer could be ſaid on either ſide, they all with one full conſent and voyce, pronounced <hi>Iohn Balioll</hi> the true and vndoubted heire to the

This blouddy battaile was fought on <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delens</hi> day in the yeare of our redemption 1298.

            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> gaue eare to their petition, hoping to gaine ſomthing by the bargaine, for with him no peny, no <hi>Pater noſter.</hi> And firſt he began to quarrel with king <hi>Edward,</hi> becauſe he would not at his intreatie reſtore vnto <hi>Edward Balliol</hi> thoſe landes in <hi>England</hi> which deſcended vpon him, by the death of <hi>Iohn Balliol</hi> his father now latelie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſſed.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:473:69"/> ſame. And by way of preuention he further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that al ſuch homage &amp; fealtie, as the kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> in former times had done to the kings of <hi>England</hi> was onely for <hi>Tiuidale, Penreth,</hi> and ſuch other Lands as they held within <hi>England,</hi> and not for the realme of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as hee would haue it. Laſtly, whereas the kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> had ſome-times ſerued the kings of <hi>England</hi> in their warres both at home and abroade, and had bin ſondry times preſent at their coronations, al this proceeded of their voluntary accord, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fauor towards them, by reaſon of their neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in bloud, and not (as he tooke it) of any duty binding them thereto. King <hi>Edward</hi> in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere herevnto, proued by euident reaſons, that the right of Superiority and command ouer the realme of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did iuſtlie belong vnto him, and that the allegations made to the contrarie were vaine and frivolous.

            <p>The truce expired, the King paſſed with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie into <hi>Scotland</hi> about Midſomer following, where he remained all that ſummer, and the next winter he kept his Chriſtmaſſe at <hi>Lithcoe,</hi> where he loſt many of his great horſes, the ſeaſon not ſeruing to make ſufficient prouiſion for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them there. The <hi>Scots</hi> in the meane time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing laboured the <hi>French</hi> king to that end, obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned another truce till Hallontide next, whervpon the King returned into <hi>England.</hi> Neither ceaſed they ſtill to perſwade the Pope to vndertake the defence of their country: but hee vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the former letters out of <hi>England,</hi> began to waxe colde in the matter, and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe beeing now falne out with the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:473:71"/> king, he hoped to procure king <hi>Edward</hi> to make war vpon him, offring to take his part in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but neither his holines nor hipocriſie preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therein. When this latter truce was come to an end, the king ſent the Lord <hi>Iohn Seagraue</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Ralfe Comfrey</hi> and a competent power to keepe the country quiet, &amp; to recouer the Caſtle of <hi>Sterling.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army entring into <hi>Lothian,</hi> ſeuered it ſelfe into three companies, foure miles diſtant one from the other, to the end they might be the more ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſerued of victualls. The enemie taking the aduantage of this manner of marching, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie in the morning ſet vpon the foremoſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, lead by the Lord <hi>Seagraue,</hi> and made ſuch ſlaughter, as fewe or none eſcaped with life. When knowledge was brought backe to theyr fellowes that followed them next in order, the Lord <hi>Neuell</hi> that had the leading thereof, with certaine horſe-men came vpon the ſpurres, and reſcued the Lord <hi>Seagraue,</hi> who otherwiſe had bin taken or ſlaine. <hi>Ralfe Comfrey</hi> after this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, not holding it conuenient to attempt any further interpriſe at that time (beeing much ouermatched with number and ſtrength) retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the reſidue into <hi>England:</hi> This ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw was giuen the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> at <hi>Roſting</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fiue miles of <hi>Edenborugh</hi> the 24. day of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary in the yeare 1302.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> was not a little moued with the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:473:71"/> loſſe of theſe men, and therefore hauing gathered a puiſſant armie, about Midſomer following hee made his laſt iourney into <hi>Scotland,</hi> purpoſing to bring the ſame wholy to his obedience. At his approach, the enemy being not able to make head againſt him, gaue way on euery ſide, flying to the Mountaines, and other places vnacceſſible, ſo as the king in manner without any reſiſtance paſſed thorow the land euen vnto <hi>Cathneſſe,</hi> the furtheſt part of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Many of them perceiuing how farre vnable they were to with-ſtand his forces, ſubmitted them-ſelues, on condition they might inioy againe their poſſeſſions, which the King had giuen to his followers the Lords of <hi>England,</hi> they redeeming the ſame of them at ſome reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable rate: where-vnto the King conſented. In his returne he cauſed the Caſtle of <hi>Sterling</hi> to be beſiedged, but he himſelfe lay at <hi>Dumfermling</hi> the greater part of the next Winter, whether the Queene his Wife (hauing remained a long time at <hi>Tinmouthe</hi>) came at length vnto him. The ſiege hauing continued three moneths, the Caſtell was ſurrendred, the liues of them that kept it onely reſerued.</p>
            <p>Before his departure, the King cauſed all the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nobilitie to repaire to Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> Towne, where they tooke a new oath of their allegiance vnto him. Such as hee held ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hee carried with him into <hi>England,</hi> togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with diuers monuments and antiquities:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:473:72"/> amongſt which, the Marble Stone of <hi>Stone</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay, wherein the Kings of that realme accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſitte at the time of their Coronation, was of ſpeciall account. It remaineth at this day at Weſtminſter, not farre from the place where hee lyeth intombed. This Stone hath ſuch a fatall deſtinie following it (as the <hi>Scottes</hi> then beleeued) as that where-ſo-euer it ſhould bee found, ouer that Countrey ſhould a <hi>Scotiſh man</hi> raigne, in how ſhort time this may come to paſſe no man knoweth. The King at his departure committing the gouernment of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Iohn Sea-graue,</hi> returned into <hi>England,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that now hee had made an end of his warres there, and brought the whole realme into a peaceable eſtate vnder his obedience: but it did not ſo fall out. For about this time dyed <hi>Robert Bruſe</hi> Earle of <hi>Carrike,</hi> who ſtood for the crowne of <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt <hi>Balliol</hi> the laſt King. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Robert Bruſe</hi> his ſonne began to caſt about, by what meanes hee might now attaine the fame. But whether hee were ſet on worke by the Lord <hi>Cumin,</hi> to the end hee might bee ſo much the neerer vnto it himſelfe, (for hee was deſcended from <hi>Mary</hi> the other Daughter of <hi>Allaine</hi> Lord of <hi>Gallowaye,</hi> and ſo after the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the two families of the <hi>Balliols</hi> and the <hi>Bruſes,</hi> was next to the Crowne,) or whether it proceeded from himſelfe (hauing ſo good title there-vnto) without acquainting the other
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:473:72"/> with his meaning, he was no ſooner entred into the plot, but was diſcouered by the Lord <hi>Cumin:</hi> which being made knowne vnto him, he thought himſelfe in no ſafety in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore by ſecret flight paſſing into <hi>Scotland,</hi> hee ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Cumin</hi> at vnawares (who otherwiſe had beene ouer-ſtrong for him) and ſo diſpatched him out of the way. Then hee cauſed himſelfe forthwith to bee crowned King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Counteſſe of <hi>Bougham,</hi> in the abſence of her brother the Earle of <hi>Fife,</hi> then in <hi>England,</hi> at his Mannor of <hi>Whitwicke</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> to whom that office by inheritance appertained. This Lady was afterwardes (for her puniſhment for this offence) put into a Cage of wood, which being placed on the walls of the Caſtell of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> was for a while made a gazing ſtock to the paſſengers by it. Immediatly vpon the newes of the coronation of <hi>Bruſe,</hi> the King ſent an army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> vnder the conduct of the Earle of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> his Lieutenant there, the Lord <hi>Henry Percie,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Robert Clifford,</hi> here-with to reſiſt the new attempts of the <hi>Scottes</hi> vnder their new King. <hi>Bruſe</hi> (in the meane time) knowing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom hee was to contend, ſought by all meanes to make himſelfe as ſtrong as poſſibly he could: &amp; therfore ranging the coaſts vp &amp; downe he aſſembled ſome fewe ſmall forces, where-with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Pembrooke</hi> by chance had firſt entred the towne with ſome 300. horſe-men, beſides foote-men. <hi>Bruſe</hi> ſent him word that he was come thither to fight with him and all his partakers, if hee would come forth. The Earle anſwered, hee would reſt that day being the Sabaoth, but on the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he would accept of his chalenge. <hi>Bruſe</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon with-drew his armie a mile backe againe from the towne, meaning to be-take himſelfe and his people that night to their reſt, but he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted ſooner then he looked; for the Earle iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the towne a little before night about the beginning of the Calends of Auguſt, aſſailed them ſo ſodenly, as that he had ſlaine a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee, before they could get armour and weapons for their defence, ſo as after a little reſiſtance the <hi>Scots</hi> with their new king were put to flight.

For <hi>Bruſe</hi> beeing not yet of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power to incounter his huge Armie, kept himſelfe out of his walke, knowing king <hi>Edward</hi> could not tary long there, becauſe he had taken ſuch order before, that nothing remained wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to relieue ſo great a number. He was no ſooner turned home-ward, but the <hi>Scots</hi> were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to follow him at his heeles, ſo as entring into <hi>Lothian,</hi> they did great hurt to the inhabitants, and returned at their pleaſure before they could be ouertaken by the <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> comming to <hi>Berwicke</hi> ſtayed there all the next winter, and fortified the Towne with a ſtrong wall and ditch, ſomewhat hee cauſed to be done likewiſe at <hi>Roxbrugh</hi> and <hi>Norham,</hi> which two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtells he committed to the cuſtodie of the Earles of <hi>Cornewall</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and ſo the next ſpring returned into <hi>England,</hi> and ceaſſing any further at this time to proſecute his affayres in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he turned all his malice and fury againſt his own ſubiects, amonſt whome the Earles of <hi>Lancaſter, Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Warwicke</hi> being not able any longer to indure the outragious pride and inſolencie of <hi>Gaueſtone,</hi> ſupported againſt them by the vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable and doting affection of the king towards him, ſought meanes to haue him apprehended, and once againe baniſhed; or, if they fayled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then to bee reuenged ſome other way. The
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:473:76"/> king hauing knowledge of their intent conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the Caſtle of <hi>Scarbrugh,</hi> not ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that it was made knowne to the Lordes his aduerſaries, who purſuing him preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thither, they forced him to yeelde himſelfe into their handes, and in concluſion (without further aduiſement) <hi>Guye</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his head to bee ſtroken off. The King (not without cauſe) tooke this their vnlawfull act in ſuch ſcorne, as that euer after (though for the preſent he diſſembled his diſpleaſure) hee fought occaſion how to bee reuenged. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this priuie hart-burne betweene the king and his Nobles, the <hi>Scotish</hi> affayres were negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on all parts, ſo as in the meane ſeaſon <hi>Bruſe</hi> had brought vnder his obedience the better part of that kingdome. Wherefore it was now high time to do ſomewhat, if the king made any rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning to hold that nation in ſuch ſtate as it was left by the late deceaſſed king his Father. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon hee once againe aſſembled a puiſſant and gallant armie, ſuch, as for multitude &amp; gorgious aray, was neuer ſeene before in <hi>Scotland</hi> purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing not onlie to make a full conqueſt thereof, but to leaue behind him ſuch ſtore of <hi>English</hi> people, as ſhould be ſufficient to inhabite thoſe Countries, which thorough the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of warre were left well neere deſolate. <hi>Bruſe</hi> vnderſtanding of this great preparation forſlaked no time to make what reſiſtance hee
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:473:76"/> could. And by how much hee was ouer weake in power, to reſiſt his aduerſarie, it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to bee ſo much the more circumſpect by art and policie to get what aduantage hee could againſt him. Hauing therefore brought his armie, (which conſiſted of ſome thirty fiue thouſand ſuch men, as repoſed theyr whole confidence for life, landes and elſe whatſoeuer onely in the force and courage of their handes and hearts) to the further banke of the Riuer <hi>Bannock,</hi> there hee ſtayed the comming of the Conqueror. This Riuer runneth into the <hi>Furth</hi> hauing very high and ſteepe bankes on both ſides, and here and there certaine ſtraite and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſages ouer it, ſome-what alſo beneath the cliftes before his fall, it lieth flat, but the paſſage ouer there was hindered, thorough cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuncken marriſh grounds and quagmires, neuertheleſſe at that time of the yeare paſſable enough in many places. In theſe plots he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed deepe ditches to bee caſt, and ſharpe poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtakes of wood to bee ſtrucken downe in them, in ſuch manner as hauing their toppes couered with light turues, they might eaſilie deceiue thoſe that fore-caſt no ſuch perill.</p>
            <p>And where the paſſage was more firme hee cauſed Caltroppes to bee ſcattered for the annoyance of the horſemen. When euery thing was thus diſpoſed and framed to his beſt aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the King of <hi>England</hi> approching with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:473:77"/> his royall Armie, ſet his people in battaile araye on this ſide the riuer ouer-againſt the <hi>Scots.</hi> The firſt day was ſpent with certaine light skirmiſhes betweene the horſe-men, not much to the loſſe or gaine of either partie. Though the night at that time of the yeare, was there very ſhort or none at all, being the xxiii. day of Iune: yet ſuch was the earneſt deſire on eyther ſide, to ioyne in fight, as that vnto them both it ſeemed ouer-long. <hi>Bruſe</hi> lead the middle battaile, hauing his brother on his right hand, and <hi>Randolph</hi> on the left. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Armie was marſhalled in the ſame manner, thoroughly interlined with good ſtore of Archers. The men of Armes gaue the firſt onſet, and ruſhing together vpon the hidden points of thoſe ſtakes, that were ſet for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they were all ouer-throwne before they could come neere the <hi>Scots,</hi> who watching the expected aduantage, and falling vpon them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, made an exceeding bloudy ſlaughter of them. They that eſcaped, made ſo confuſed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traite, as the maine battaile of foot-men that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them was not a little thereby diſordered. The <hi>Scottes</hi> therewith ioyned with them hand to hand, and maintained the fight very valiantly, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Archers fot a time were very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome vnto them, vntill certaine light horſe-men aſſailing them at their backes, ouer-threw a great number, and diſperſed the reſt. But yet the enemies force preuailed not ſo much, as did his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:473:77"/> ftaud, here againe, for the raſcall ſort, men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and boyes, that attended their cariages, mounting vpon their Cart-iades, and other Draught-cattle, with their ſherts aboue their other garments, and banners and flagges made of their ſheetes and aprons, and ſuch like ſtuffe, faſtned to the tops of long poles, ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a farre off, deſcending from the top of an high hill, as if it had beene a new Armie haſting to the ayde of their fellowes. This ſight ſtroke ſuch a terror in thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army that were neereſt vnto it, as that forth-with they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke them to their heeles. The reſt ſuppoſing the danger greater then it was, and beeing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with much diſordered, fled all for feare they knew not whereof, their Captaines not beeing able by any meanes to keepe them in Exceeding great ſlaughter was made of the common ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the chaſe.

All this ſhould bee done (they write) in the yeare 1331. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1331"/> two yeares after the death of King <hi>Robert,</hi> in which the gouernor alſo deceaſed, on the 20. day of Iuly. I would firſt know what ſhould mooue the King of <hi>England</hi> to ſeeke the deſtruction of him, more then of any man elſe in that Realme? becauſe (forſooth)
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:473:85"/> hee alone was the confounder of all the hope, which the king conceiued, to be ſometimes able to atchieue any fortunate interpriſe againſt the <hi>Scots.</hi> As though all that nation could not afford his fellowe. That hee was the very <hi>Atlas</hi> and ſupporter of their happy eſtate. True it is, that the deceaſſed king had reaſon to commit more truſt to him, then to anie other of whoſe loyalty and ſufficiencie he had not the like tryall. But it followeth not thereof, that if king <hi>Edward</hi> could diſpatch him out off the waie, there had beene none left to haue reſiſted his attempts againſt that nation.</p>
            <p>But admit he was the man they make him, it is well knowne that King <hi>Edward</hi> (being then not much aboue eighteene yeares old) was not only ouer yong to contriue ſuch a practiſe, but was then ſtill directed by his Mother Queene <hi>Iſabel,</hi> &amp; ſo conſequently by <hi>Mortimer</hi> Earle of <hi>March</hi> her chiefe Counſellor, both ſo great fauourers and maintainers of the peace with <hi>Scotland,</hi> as that hee loſt his life ſhortlie after for the ſame. It is further affirmed, That this Monke ſtealing ſecretlie out off <hi>Scotland</hi> aſſured the King, that the Gouernor could not poſſiblie liue beyond a prefixed day, in which time, the poyſon was to worke his effect, and that King <hi>Edward</hi> preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thereof, gathered a mightie and puiſſant armie, wherewith comming to the borders, hee purpoſed to inuade <hi>Scotland,</hi> had he not knowne
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:473:86"/> when he came thyther, that the gouernour was not only lyuing, but ready in armes to haue reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his approach. Now of all this preparation and iourney, there is not one word to be found amongſt all our Croniclers. But to the contrarie it appeareth, that (beſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of the former peace, vpon the admittance of this Earle to the Regency) the ſommer next before his death, was ſo vnſeaſonable, as that it cauſed a great dearth in <hi>England</hi> all the yeare following: ſo as it was impoſſible to make prouiſion for ſuch an army, neither could thoſe more Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then partes afford it of their owne ſtore. For (it is ſayd) that in ſome places of the realme, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie North-wards (by reaſon of the coldneſſe of that climate) wheate was not gathered into the barne till hallontide, nor peaſe vntill the ende of Nouember.

How can all this agree with the ſurmiſed preparation of warre with <hi>Scotland,</hi> at that time? Now to the laſt poynt touching the burning of this Monke, (whereof ſome of them for the vnlike-lihood-haue not ſpoken) it is incredible, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:473:86"/> man, a deuout Monke (as they were then accounted) ſhould bee either murthered or executed, for not keeping promiſe, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of an vnlawfull and vnchriſtian act. But where, when, on whome, or by whome was this vnuſuall execution made? to no one of theſe interrogatories doth any man anſwere, ſaue that hee was a Monke or begging Frier. For they will not vouchſafe to giue him other name, though hee had beene a long time verie familier in the gouernors houſe.

            <p>This yeare <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earle of <hi>March</hi> was attaynted of high treaſon, and executed for the ſame on Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> eauen. Amongſt other matters where-with hee was charged, hee was found giltie of ſecrete practiſe with the <hi>Scottes</hi> at <hi>Stanhope-parke</hi> whereby they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped as is aforeſaid, and that hee receiued there of the Lord <hi>Iames Dowglas,</hi> a great ſumme of money for the good ſeruice done by him at that time, and to bee ſtill continewed towardes that Nation whileſt his authoritie ſhould ſtand them inſteede.

            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:473:87"/>
            <p>About this time <hi>Edward Balliol,</hi> thorough the perſwaſion of <hi>Laurence Twine</hi> (a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> fugitiue) came ouer out off <hi>France,</hi> where hee had alwayes liued before, to intreat the King of <hi>England</hi> to aſſiſt him in the recouery of his right to the Crowne of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was giuen by a ward vnto <hi>Iohn Balliol</hi> by king <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing withall, that if it were his good hap to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, he would acknowledge to hold the ſame in manner as his Grand-father held it of the others Grand-father.</p>
            <p>But before this motion was made to the king of <hi>England: Balliol</hi> ſought the fauour of the Lord <hi>Henry Beumont</hi> (a <hi>Frenchman</hi> borne) that had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the daughter and heyre of the Earle <hi>Buquhan</hi> and likewiſe of the Lord <hi>William Cumine,</hi> the lord <hi>Dauid</hi> of <hi>Strabouee</hi> Earle of <hi>Atholl,</hi> and the lord <hi>Geffrey de Mowbraie.</hi> Theſe and ſome others that were baniſhed the Realme of <hi>Scotland</hi> by the late King <hi>Robert le Bruſe,</hi> &amp; now liued in <hi>England,</hi> hauing in hope of preferment ioyned heartes &amp; handes with <hi>Balliol</hi> in this quarell, obtained this fauour of king <hi>Edward,</hi> that as many of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as of themſelues were willing to aſſiſt them in this enterpriſe ſhould haue good leaue to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them therein. For though the young king of <hi>Scots</hi> had beene affianced vnto king <hi>Edwards</hi> ſiſter, who in reſpect of that alliance ſhould not haue beene eaſilie drawne into this action: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe he held himſelfe ſo m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:473:87"/> and abſued in his minority by the deceitful prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Mortimer,</hi> that nothing now pleaſed him, that (together with that mariage) was then yeelded vnto, at that diſhonorable compoſition made with the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> king at <hi>Northampton</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you haue heard.

This good bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning put ſuch corage into theſe venterous companions in armes (fighting for no leſſe then a kingdome) that with in ſome fewe daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (their forces beeing now increaſed to the number of about ten thouſand one and other) they attempted to aſſaile the Earle of <hi>Muerry</hi> (then Regent of <hi>Scotland</hi>) by night, where hee laie incamped in the middeſt of his armie, the ſame beeing ouer great otherwiſe to bee delt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:473:88"/> withall, and tooke him on ſuch a ſodaine that they put him to flight, making great ſlaughter vpon his people. The next day the fight was renewed on both ſides, but in the ende the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fell to <hi>Balliol.</hi> This battaile was fought at <hi>Dueplin</hi> on the thirteenth day of the ſame mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th, wherein was ſlaine (nowe and the night before) beſides the Regent himſelfe, <hi>Robert Bruſe</hi> Earle of <hi>Carricke, William Haie</hi> Conſtable, and <hi>Robert Keithe</hi> Marſhall of <hi>Scotland</hi> with diuerſe other Lords and Leardes of good account: in the whole to the number of aboue fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
            <p>Hereupon (diuerſe of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nobility ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytting themſelues to <hi>Balliol</hi>) hee was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with proclamed, and on the 25. day of this preſent month of Auguſt, crowned King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord GOD 1332. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1332"/> This his fortunate ſucceſſe (hauing within leſſe then a month attayned a Kingdome) great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie daunted the aduerſe partie, who preſently thereupon conuaied the young king together with his wife, for their more ſafty into <hi>France,</hi> hoping that by the helpe of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> king, (his fathers eſpeciall friend while he liued) he ſhould one day inioy his kingdome, which for the preſent was thus vſurped by his aduerſarie. To which end his fauoreres in the meane time neuer ceaſed to oppoſe themſelues againſt <hi>Balliol,</hi> in ſo much as in December following
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:473:88"/> they droue him out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> forceing him to with-drawe himſelfe into <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> where hee was honorablie entertayned of the Lord <hi>Clifford:</hi> in requitall whereof hee promiſed, that when hee was once eſtabliſhed in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hee would giue him <hi>Dowglaſſe-daile,</hi> in as ample manner as his Anceſtour had the ſame of the gift of King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes hee performed accordinglie. <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liol</hi> hauing renewed his forces in <hi>England,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of the next yeare, (though King <hi>Edward</hi> would not openlie ſhewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a partie therein) layed ſiedge to the towne of <hi>Berwike,</hi> at which time the <hi>Bruſian Scottes</hi> entred into <hi>Gelſland</hi> by the Weſt Marches, waſting the Countrie where they paſſed along.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> being aduertiſed therof-thought himſelfe ſufficiently diſcharged there, by of his promiſe paſſed aforetime to young <hi>Bruſe</hi> (but hee might better haue pleaded his nonage at the making thereof) and therefore tooke it to bee nowe lawfull enough open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to aide his Couſin <hi>Balliol</hi> in the recouerie of his pretended title to the Crowne of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> It is not to bee doubted but King <hi>Edward</hi> would not in this caſe haue preferred <hi>Balliol</hi> before <hi>Bruſe</hi> (who beſides that hee had married his Siſter, was alſo in bloud nearer vnto him then the other) had hee not hoped (as it came,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:473:89"/> to paſſe) to take vp the controuerſie betweene them to his owne aduantage. Hauing therefore aſſembled a ſtrong army, hee came therewith to the ſiedge of <hi>Berwicke,</hi> together with his brother <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Eltham</hi> Earle of <hi>Cornewall</hi> and gaue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault to the ſame both by Land and ſea. The towne after it had beene beſiedged about three monthes, was not able longer to hold out, which beeing well knowne to <hi>Archibald Dowglaſſe</hi> (the new elected gouernour and head of the <hi>Bruſian</hi> faction) hee approched the aſſailants with all the power hee could make, (reſoluing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (againſt the aduice of the better experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) to try it out by dint of ſword with out any more ſtay. Being come within the view both of his friends and foes, he imbattayled his army in three companies on a hill directly ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hoſt, which had the like aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ground alſo. After ſome pauſe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on both ſides deſcended one towards the other.</p>
            <p>At the firſt incounter the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe giuing ground, the <hi>Scottes</hi> purſued them ſo egarlie, as that by recouering their former aduantage they did beate them downe-right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſo that what in fight and ſlight the ſlaughter was very great. For beſides their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, three valiant Gentlemen the Sonnes of <hi>Walter Steward</hi> (Vncles to him that ſucceeded the <hi>Bruſian</hi> linage in <hi>Scotland</hi>) the Earles

This bloudie battaile was fought at <hi>Halidon</hi> hill beſides <hi>Berwike</hi> on <hi>Mary Magdalines</hi> day in the yeare of our Lord 1333. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1333"/> Immediatly vpon this ouerthrowe, <hi>Alexander Seaton</hi> and <hi>Patrike Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> deſpayring of any ſuccour, yeelded vp the towne and Caſtle to king <hi>Edward,</hi> life and goods only reſerued, and binding themſelues by oth thence-forth to become his true ſubiects. <hi>Patrike Du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bar</hi> was further inioyned to re-edifie the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of <hi>Dumbar</hi> at his owne charge, hauing late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie before throwne it downe, becauſe hee was vnable to defend it againſt the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to aſſault the ſame. VVhat credit is here to be giuen to <hi>Hector Boetius,</hi> charging King <hi>Edward</hi> to haue vniuſtlie executed two Sonnes of Sir <hi>Alexander Seatons,</hi> the one a pleadge, the other a priſonner, becauſe hee would not yeelde vp the towne at the approach of the gouernour? I leaue it to the conſideration of the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reader. For mine owne part I cannot but hold him much ſuſpected, his report alone car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying ſo little ſhowe of truth, for as it ſeemeth by the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Cronicle, <hi>Patrike Dumbar</hi> had as great a commaunde in <hi>Berwike</hi> as the other, whoſe conſent alone could not haue effected

The King of <hi>England</hi> after this his firſt and fortunate battaile in <hi>Scotland,</hi> leauing ſufficient forces behinde him with the Lord <hi>Richard Tailbote,</hi> wherwith to aide <hi>Balliol</hi> in the purſute of this warre, returned home-wards. <hi>Balliol</hi> being thus ſtrengthned, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at his pleaſure thorough <hi>Scotland,</hi> placing <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and others his partakers, in garriſon in the greater number of the Caſtells &amp; fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of that Realme, and in a Parliament called at <hi>Perthe</hi> in September following, hee was further confirmed King of <hi>Scotland:</hi> diuerſe of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nobility there aſſembled binding themſelues by othes to continew his loyall and faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.

            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:473:90"/>
            <p>After the purification of the Virgine <hi>Mary</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> repayred to <hi>Yorke,</hi> where <hi>Balliol</hi> by appoyntment ſhould haue met him to haue don homage and fealty vnto him, but becauſe he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ſurpriſed in his paſſage by his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, hee ſent his excuſe by the Lord <hi>Henry Beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and the Lord <hi>William de Montaigne.</hi> The king therefore paſſing further Northwards, held his VVhitſontide at <hi>Newcaſtell</hi> vpon <hi>Tine</hi> with great royaltie, whether the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> king repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and there did homage vnto king <hi>Edward</hi> for the Realme of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and alſo ſweare fealtie vnto him, as to the ſuperior Lord ouer the ſame, acknowleding to hold that Realme of him, his heires and ſucceſſors for euer. At this meeting <hi>Balliol</hi> freelie gaue to king <hi>Edward</hi> the Caſtells and townes of <hi>Berwike, Roxbrugh, Peplies, Dunfries, Hadingtone</hi> and <hi>Gedworthe,</hi> with the foreſtes of <hi>Silkerke</hi> and <hi>Etherike,</hi> ſo as all the premiſes ſhould bee thence-forth cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſeperated from the Crowne of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and annexed to the Crowne of <hi>England:</hi> all this was then firmely ratified and aſſured by oth, writing, and witneſſe in the yeare. 1334. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1334"/> King <hi>Edward</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing departed homewards, <hi>Balliol</hi> was ſtill ſet on worke by them of the <hi>Bruſian</hi> faction, in whoſe hands ſtill remayned ſundry ſtrong Caſtells and fortifications, as <hi>Dunbritanie, Lochleuin, Keldromie, Vrquhart,</hi> and the ſtronge pile of <hi>Lowdone,</hi> ſo that as oportunitie ſerued, one or

For the ſuppreſſing hereof king <hi>Edward</hi> made his third voyage into <hi>Scotland</hi> the Summer following, in the yeare 1335. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1335"/> His nauy at this time alſo (for in his former iorneys thither hee was euer as well prouided by ſea as by land) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of ſome hundred and fifty ſaile, well reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with men, munition, and victualls. By land he was accompanied with <hi>Balliol,</hi> and his brother the Earle of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> diuerſe great Lords atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon them. Being entred into <hi>Scotland</hi> they deuided themſelues ſometimes into two, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into three ſeuerall companies, in which manner they paſſed at their pleaſure without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, aſwell beyond the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> fourth, as on this ſide the ſame. In the meane time the Earle of <hi>Athol</hi> repaired to the king, ſubmitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againe to his obedience, by whoſe example
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:473:91"/> diuers other did the like, but this Earle was ſhortly after ſlaine at the ſiedge of the Caſtell of <hi>Keldromie.</hi> At the approach of winter king <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> with-drew himſelfe to <hi>Newcaſtel,</hi> where hee kept the feaſt of the Natiuity of our Lord.

VVhile this good courſe was intended and fully agreed vpon on all ſides, the Lord <hi>Maurice de Murrey</hi> ſlewe Sir <hi>Geffery de Ros</hi> a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> knight, and Sheriffe of <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Leuarke,</hi> one of <hi>Balliol</hi> his partakers, becauſe in time of warre hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſlaine his brother. By reaſon of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptious part, and the frowardneſſe of the <hi>Scottes</hi> on both ſides, ſtill ſeeking reuenge one of the other, this treatie tooke no effect. The next Sommer about VVhitſontide the king ſent an army into <hi>Scotland</hi> vnder the conduct of <hi>Balliol</hi> and diuers <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords, who finding the towne of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> defaced by the enemies (not able

King <hi>Edward</hi> about this time was at a Parliament holden at <hi>Northamptone,</hi> where leauing his Lordes and the reſt to treate of ſuch matters, as were propounded amongſt them, hee poſted into the North partes: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Berwike,</hi> from thence with a ſlender at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance hee arriued at <hi>Saint Iohns</hi> towne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any man there had heard of his intention.

From hence the King paſſed forwards with ſome part of his army, as farre as <hi>Elgen</hi> in <hi>Murrey-land,</hi> thence to <hi>Inuerneſſe,</hi> much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into <hi>Scotland</hi> then euer the King his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father had done before. In the meane time the Earle of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> with the power of <hi>Yorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Northumberland</hi> men, and the Lord <hi>Anthony Lucie</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> &amp; <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> entred into <hi>Scotland,</hi> waſted and ſpoyled the VVeſt partes, as <hi>Carrick</hi> and others which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayed not <hi>Balliol.</hi> The Lord <hi>Dowglaſſe</hi> by coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> did his beſt to hinder their courſe. At length this armie hauing done what harme it could, was ſent home, with great prey and bootie, but the Earle of <hi>Cornewall</hi> with his owne people came thorow to <hi>Saint Iohns</hi> towne where he found the king returned from beyond the Mountaines. Here ſome of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters charge the King to haue ſlaine this Earle his

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſmart moſt for the obſtinacy of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But for any violence vſed by the king to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his brother, it is ſo far from any colour of truth, that euen the better ſort of their own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue ſuppreſſed that report, as a vaine and meere forgery. For it wel appeareth by our own writers that this Earle died there of a natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, &amp; his body was brought to <hi>England</hi> &amp; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with all ſolemnity therto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing. The king wholy ſpent theſe 2. laſt years in eſtabliſhing of <hi>Balliol</hi> in the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Scotland</hi> becauſe he was deſirous to make all ſure on that ſide, whileſt he followed his wars in <hi>France,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now hee began to ſet al his thoughts.

Shortly after the kings returne home, war was proclaimed with <hi>France,</hi> and all things forth-with were in preparing for that iorneye.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:473:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> The next yeare the warre in <hi>Scotland</hi> proceeded with equall loſſe and diſaduantage on both ſides. towards the end of the ſame yeare, the king ſent thyther an army of ſome twenty thouſand men, vnder the leading of the new created Earles of <hi>Saliſbury, Gloceſter,</hi> and <hi>Derbie,</hi> and of as many Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones, <hi>Percy, Neuille,</hi> and <hi>Stafford.</hi> Theſe beſiedged the caſtell of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> but to their ſmall aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and leſſe credit. For hauing continewed the ſiedge about twenty weekes; vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a truce, before it was diſtreſſed, they gaue it ouer, being more deſirous to attend the king their maiſter into <hi>France,</hi> where there was more good to be done: <hi>Scotland</hi> then affording no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but hunger and blowes, beare them of as they could. About the middeſt of Iune in the yeare of our Lord 1338. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1338"/> the king of <hi>England</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Queene, the Prince of <hi>Walles,</hi> &amp; a great number of the Nobility that did attend them, paſſed ouer into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and were ioyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie entertayned of the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Lords of the Empire his confederates, towards the attayning of the crowne of <hi>France,</hi> which he claimed as the next heire therevnto by Queene <hi>Iſabel</hi> his mother, Daughter to <hi>Philip</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the faire.

To which end, within the firſt three yeares after his returne, hee made three iourneyes into the land, doing what harme he could to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries bordering vpon <hi>Scotland,</hi> but all was of no great reckning.

At his firſt entry hee made manie knights, whereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corage them the more to ſhowe their valiancie, but amongſt the reſt for his former good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice he created <hi>William Dowglas</hi> an Earle, whoſe Father was ſlaine at <hi>Halidone</hi> hill, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd. The number of Noble men and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aſſembled at this time, by the confeſſion of their owne writers, were verie neere two thouſand; in the whole (as ſome write) three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand.

The Queene of <hi>England,</hi> being then returned home, to repreſſe the inſolency of the enemy, gathered togither ſuch forces as the Realme could then redily afford, to the number of twelue hundred men of armes, three thouſand Archers and ſome ſeauen thouſand other, of whome a great part were Preeſtes and Prelates, but good talle tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher-men ſuch as were not afraide of a crackt crowne though they had no haire to hide thoſe hurtes withall.

In the morning earlie before the fight, <hi>Dowglas</hi> iſſued fourth with certaine troopes of horſe-men to diſcouer the behauiour of the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and vpon good occaſion offred to ſkirmiſh with them.

               <hi>Engliſh</hi> Archers, hoping thereby to haue diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them. But he was ſo ſharply repulſed, as that looſing many of his troopes, hee had much adoe to recouer the maine battaile againe. Not-with-ſtanding theſe two foule foyles, they preſumed ſo much vpon their aduantage in number, that forth-with they fiercely ruſhed vpon the <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> The fight begun about nine of the clocke, and continued till noone, at what time God gaue the victory to the <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> The <hi>Scotiſh</hi> writers attribute the loſſe of this battaile to the vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed retraite of the Earle of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>Robert Steward;</hi> but where-ſo-euer the fault was, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great number of them was ſlaine.

            <p>This battaile was fought in the yeare 1388. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1388"/> The number of the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſlaine (as <hi>Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Boetius</hi> reporteth) were fiue hundred, not without ſome ſlaughter alſo of the <hi>Scottes,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whome the Earle <hi>Dowglas</hi> was of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall account, hauing receiued manie mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wounds.

But manie more were taken in their flight, for the <hi>Scottes</hi> purſued them ſo egarlie in the chaſe, as that two hundred of themſelues aduenturing ouer farre, were taken priſoners by the <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Buchanan</hi> doth otherwiſe report this iorney, <hi>Viz.</hi> That after the <hi>Scottes</hi> had diuided themſelues into two companies they met not againe, till after the battaile of <hi>Otterbourne,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the Earle <hi>Dowglas,</hi> both at the ſame battaile, and alſo before at the aſſault of <hi>New-caſtell,</hi> had not in his armie aboue three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men of all ſortes, whereas the two <hi>Percies</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:473:104"/> brought with them to <hi>Otterbourne</hi> ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand choiſe men.</p>
            <p>But herein he doth not onely diſagree from the other <hi>Scottiſh</hi> writers, but alſo from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For (ſaith he) when the two armies par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it was agreed vpon amongſt them, that neither of them ſhould attempt to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> vntill both the armies were met againe, each of them conſiſting (as ſome report) of fifteene thouſand men a peece. And therfore it is moſt vnlikely that <hi>Dowglas</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his former appointment, &amp; againſt al ſence would aduenture to aſſault <hi>Newcaſtell</hi> with ſo few as hee ſpeaketh of, or willinglie abide the comming of the <hi>Percies,</hi> againſt the liking of the greater number of his owne people (as hee reporteth). It is therefore more probable that when the two <hi>Scottiſh</hi> armies were met a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, according to their appointment, the Earle <hi>Dowglas</hi> (to whoſe onelie direction the reſt referred themſelues) making choiſe of the moſt able men amongſt them, ſent the reſidewe home-wards, with ſuch ſpoyle as they had gotten in this iorney, vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Earle of <hi>Fife</hi> and his brother, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe the King their Father was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquainted with this preparation into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (as beeing more inclined to peace then to warre) neither knewe hee that his Sonnes were amongſt them. Amongſt others that had
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:473:105"/> the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> in chaſe after this laſt conflict, it fell out that <hi>Iames Lindſey</hi> a <hi>Scot,</hi> hauing the aduantage of weapon and armour, tooke <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Redman</hi> (the Gouernour of <hi>Berwike</hi>) pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, whoe was preſentlie diſmiſſed vppon his oath, that within twenty daies after hee would yeeld him ſelfe priſoner againe vnto him. <hi>Iames Lindſey</hi> immediatelie returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his companie, which (as hee tooke it) he had ſoone after in ſight. But when hee was come ſo neare, that it auayled not to retire, he found them to bee a band of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Biſhoppe of <hi>Durham.</hi> For the Biſhoppe beeing come to <hi>New-castle</hi> to ioyne with the <hi>Percies,</hi> according to a former appointment, vnderſtanding that they were the ſame daie gone to ſeeke the enemie, made but ſmall haſt after them, ſuppoſing (by reaſon of their weake attendance) that they would attempt nothing before his comming to their ſuccour the next morning, but in their paſſage that night towardes <hi>Otterburne,</hi> the Biſhoppe vnderſtood by thoſe that had eſcaped by flight, that the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> had alreadie fought with the <hi>Scottes,</hi> and were diſcomfeited, wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on returning backe againe to the towne, hee incountred <hi>Lindeſey</hi> thus alone. When Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Redman</hi> had eſpied his late acquaintance <hi>Iames Lindſey</hi> brought to <hi>New-caſtell</hi> as a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, with all curtiſie hee intertayned him, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:473:105"/> vpon euen hands the one redeemed the others lybertie. In like manner vpon the returne of of the <hi>Scottes</hi> home-wards, the younger brother of the <hi>Percies</hi> (becauſe by reaſon of his wounds hee was not able to take ſo great iorneyes) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned libertie to returne to <hi>Newcaſtell</hi> for his ſpeedier recouerie promiſing; that when hee ſhould bee better able to trauell, hee would at any time beeing called thereto, yeeld his bodie againe. Vpon the ſame condition (ſaith <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanane</hi>) were ſixe hundred more at that time ſet at lybertie to go whether they would.

               <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Dumbar</hi> Earle of the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> had betrothed his Daughter to the King his Maiſters Sonne and heire, the Father not only conſenting therevnto, but alſo recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a good part of the marriage monie.

            </p>
            <p>The Earle <hi>Dowglas</hi> taking indignation, that any other of that Nation, ſhould bee herein preferred before him, and complayning that the conſent of the <hi>States</hi> was to much neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in not beeing made acquainted with a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that importance, as appertayned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: offred a Daughter of his owne with a greater portion. Hereof king <hi>Robert</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and forth-with made vp the marriage. <hi>Dumbar</hi> complayning of this wronge, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the monie his king had receiued, but hee could not receiue ſo much as a kinde anſwere of him.</p>
            <p>This double iniury done him by the <hi>Dowg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> both the loſſe of his monie and (which hee eſteemed farre more) of the kinges fauour, did not a little trouble him. Therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other meanes to bee hereof reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, hee leaft both Court and Country, and repayring into <hi>England</hi> complayned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto <hi>Henrie</hi> the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:473:107"/> of whome he hoped to be relieued. In the meane time, the Earle <hi>Dowglas</hi> ſeized on the Caſtell of <hi>Dunbar</hi> in the King his Maiſters name, which was committed to the cuſtodie of <hi>Robert Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at the Earle of <hi>March</hi> his departure into <hi>England.

But comming to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> the Earle <hi>Dowglas</hi> hauing fortified the Caſtell, would not admit him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, anſwering that hee kept it to the vſe of the King, who had ſent him thither to that end. The other Earle, ſeeing his greateſt enemie ſo much to triumph ouer him, could not brooke it, but without making further meanes to the King, at whoſe hands he ought eſpecially to haue fought for remedy, hee together with his wife, children, and allies, returned againe into <hi>England,</hi> informing the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> of all the diſpleaſures done vnto him by his aduerſary the <hi>Dowglas,</hi> and withall deſired him (ſeeing he could not otherwiſe preuaile) to aide him in the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of his poſſeſſions by force, ſithence by force they were kept againſt him. Herevpon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſome ſtirres by the riſing of the borderers on both ſides, who ioyning then forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did the <hi>Dowglas</hi> all the miſchiefe they could. King <hi>Robert</hi> not a little moued here-with, did write to king <hi>Henry,</hi> that vnleſſe he would deliuer
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:473:107"/> into his hands the fugitiue Earle, he would take it for a breach of the truce, and proceed againſt him accordingly. What anſwer ſoeuer king <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> made here-vnto, it deſerued not ſo bitter a reprehenſion, as wher-with <hi>Buchanan</hi> doth check him. Impudency is a foule fault in a priuate man, much more in a Prince. I hold him of a very fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward temper, that in his writings cannot afford a King his good words, although they ſhow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſlike of their actions. King <hi>Robert</hi> vpon the returne of his meſſenger, cauſed open warre to be proclaimed, and Sir <hi>William Logon</hi> a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Knight was forth-with ſent to the Sea, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſett on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fleete, that was then fiſhing on the coaſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> about <hi>Aberden.</hi> But hee was incountred with certaine ſhips of <hi>Lin,</hi> and by them taken priſoner. The Fiſher-men vnderſtanding what was intended againſt them, entring into ſome of the Iles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> carried away with them; whatſoeuer was worth their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſet the reſt on fire. King <hi>Henry</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing what was to be looked for out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> thought it good in the beginning either to draw the <hi>Scots</hi> to peace, or to reſiſt their malice, before further miſchiefe ſhould inſue therof. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing a great armie, hee there-with entred into <hi>Scotland</hi> about the middeſt of Auguſt, being the eleuenth month from his coronation. From <hi>Hadington</hi> he paſſed to <hi>Leeth,</hi> vſing much clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in all places where he came, eſpecially to the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:473:108"/> houſes of religion. Where-vpon diuers Caſtels &amp; Houlds willingly ſubmitted themſelues vnto him. Comming to <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> he beſiedged the Caſtle. Hither <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Albanie</hi> gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Scotland</hi> vnder the King his brother, (who by reaſon of his impotencie could not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in his perſon) ſent an <hi>Harald</hi> of Armes vnto king <hi>Henry,</hi> promiſing to giue him battaile with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſixe dayes at the furtheſt, if hee would ſtay ſo long. The King accepting the offer, gaue the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger for his good newes a chaine of gold, and a Sattin gowne at his departure. But neither at the end of ſixe or ſixteene dayes heard he any more of the Gouernours comming. The <hi>Scottiſh</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters attribute this diſhonorable dealing to the Dukes ambition, whom it would not haue trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, though the Caſtle had beene taken, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the young Prince of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the ſame, that thereby hee might haue beene in ſo much the more hope of the crowne him-ſelfe, after which (it was thought) he greatly thirſted. But on the other ſide, they highly extoll the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular moderation of King <hi>Henry,</hi> who by this his gentle inuaſion ſeemed rather deſirous to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure them to peace, then to afflict them with the calamities alwayes accompaning warre. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter approaching, the King brake vp the ſiedge, and returned home without any ſhew of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, greatly to the Gouernours reproach: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewing him-ſelfe deſirous of warre, nor
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:473:108"/> willing to offer conditions of peace, how ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent tokens ſoeuer was ſhowed by king <hi>Henry</hi> of his readineſſe to haue accepted thereof. After ſome little harme done, the next Summer by the borderers on both ſides, <hi>Patrike Hepburne</hi> with ſome greater powre, entred further into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> and hauing gotten a good bootie, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall returning home-wards, hee was ouer-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> at <hi>Nesbet</hi> in the <hi>Meirs,</hi> where their Captaine, together with the greater number of his people, well neere the very flowre of all the <hi>Lothian</hi> youth, were beaten downe and ſlaine in fight. Amongſt thoſe that were taken priſoners, <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>William Cockburne, Robert Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Iohn</hi> and <hi>Thomas Haliburton,</hi> were the men of beſt account. This ouer-throw was giuen the <hi>Scottes</hi> on the xxii. day of Iune, in the yeare 1401. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1401"/> The Earle <hi>Archibald Dowglas,</hi> ſonne to the other <hi>Dowglas,</hi> that was the great enimie to the Earle of <hi>March,</hi> his Country-man, who decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the yeare before, being much mooued with this ouer-throw, made great preparation againſt the next Summer, to lead an armie into <hi>England,</hi> there-with to take reuenge for the death of ſo many his good friends and countrey-men. But his ſucceſſe was no better then theirs. For when his armie had done all the harme it could within the realme, as farre as <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> &amp; was returning homewards with an exceeding great prey, <hi>Henry</hi> (ſurnamed <hi>Hoteſpurre</hi>) that was taken priſoner at

            <p>While King <hi>Henrie</hi> was therefore prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an armie, where-with to paſſe againe into <hi>Wales</hi> (for hee had beene latelie there beefore) <hi>Thomas Percie</hi> Earle of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> gaue ſecret intelligence thereof to his brother the Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who togither with his Sonne the Lord <hi>Henrie,</hi> and the Earle <hi>Dowg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> his priſoner, with ſuch aide as by his meanes, they could get out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> gathered a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſome foureteene thouſand choſen men, of whome the greater number were <hi>Cheſhire</hi>

But the king (by the continuall calling on of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Earle of <hi>March,</hi> who tooke his part) made ſuch ſpeed, as that approaching the rebels ſooner then they looked, that enterpriſe was preuented. When the two armies were mette, and euery man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to fight, the King offered them pardon vpon any reaſonable conditions. But by the perſwaſion of the Earle of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> (who from the beginning was the chiefe worker of all this miſchiefe) there was no way but to trye it out by dint of ſword.

Whereas it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt enough, that aboue a yeare before this, the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and the Lord <hi>Bardolfe,</hi> after they had bin in <hi>Wales, Flaunders</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to haue purchaſed aide againſt King <hi>Henry,</hi> were returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and now not aboue ſixe or ſeauen weekes before the arriuall of the yong Prince in <hi>England</hi> were entred into the Realme with a power of <hi>Scottes,</hi> and comming into <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> were incountred and ouerthrowne by Sir <hi>Thomas Rookſbie</hi> then Sheriffe of the Shire, on the nineteenth day of Februarie in the yeare 1407. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1407"/> The Earle himſelfe was ſlaine in the field, and the Lord <hi>Bardolfe</hi> ſore wounded, as beeing taken, he died thereof ſhortlie after. Hereby it appeareth, that either there was no truce at al at this time, or elſe the <hi>Scottes</hi> made ſmall account thereof; taking part with the enemies of the land againſt their natural King, within his owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Howſoeuer the Sonnes captiuity did for the preſent trouble the ſickly olde King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The <hi>Scottes</hi> haue had no cauſe ſinne to bee
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:473:113"/> much offended thereat. For (as it is confeſſed by themſelues) king <hi>Henrie</hi> tooke ſo great care for his education, in all manner of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline fit for his calling, as that Realme had neuer before a Prince furniſhed with more excellent qualities. No doubt king <hi>Henrie</hi> hereby ſought in kindneſſe to binde him and that Nation to a perpetuall acknowledgment of his ſinguler loue and fauor towards the one and the other. But as the ſequell ſhowed, the ſame was little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing regarded afterwards. The death of king <hi>Robert</hi> made no alteration in the ſtate of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with him died onely the title of king; for the other <hi>Robert</hi> his brother, the Duke of <hi>Albaine</hi> in manner as before, ſo ſtill he inioyed the ſoueraigne command ouer that Nation. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time, or not long before Sir <hi>Robert Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freuille</hi> high admirall of <hi>England</hi> burnt the towne of <hi>Peples</hi> on the market day, cauſing his men to make ſo good penie-worthes of the cloathes they got there, as that therevpon the <hi>Scottes</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him <hi>Robin</hi> mend market. In the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Caſtell of <hi>Iedworth</hi> (which the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> had held euer ſince the battaile at <hi>Durham</hi> (was taken by <hi>Tyuidale</hi> men and throwne downe to the ground. Shortly after the Earle of <hi>March</hi> (who before at a Parliament was recommended by the commons of <hi>England,</hi> to the kings gratious conſideration ouer his due demerites, for his good ſeruice done in the Realme) returned into
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:473:114"/> 
               <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was reſtored to his former digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and poſſeſſions there. The <hi>Scottes</hi> thought themſelues not ſufficientlie reuenged for the markets, that Sir <hi>Robert Vmfreuille</hi> lately made of their goods in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore in the yeare following, <hi>Patrike Dumbar,</hi> ſecond Sonne to the Earle of <hi>March</hi> with an hundred men well apoynted for the purpoſe, came earelie one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſome-what before day, to <hi>Faſt</hi> Caſtell, and entring into the ſame tooke the Captaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of priſoner, who by daily out-roades greatlie indamaged the Countrie next adioyning. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame time <hi>Gawin Dumbar</hi> an other Sonne of the ſayd Earle, togither with <hi>William Dowglas,</hi> brake downe the bridge of <hi>Roxbrughe,</hi> and ſet the towne on fire, but durſt not attempt the taking of the Caſtell. Sir <hi>Robert Vmfreuille</hi> hauing by this time vttered all his merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice by the meaſure of his mens long-bowes, for the worth of ſo manie yardes, thought it now high time to make a new aduenture, and therefore in the yeare 1410. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1410"/> Hee entred the <hi>Furth</hi> with tenne talle ſhippes of warre, where lying for the ſpace of a fort-night togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee ſome-times landed on the one ſide, and ſome-times on the other, carying ſtill with him manie good booties, not-with-ſtanding that the Gouernour and the Earle <hi>Dowglas</hi> were both readie to reſiſt him. Hee burned the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liot</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> (a Shippe of greateſt account)
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:473:114"/> with manie other ſmaller veſſelles lying then at the <hi>Blackneſſe</hi> ouer againſt <hi>Leeth.</hi> At his returne into <hi>England</hi> hee brought with him foureteene good ſhippes with many commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as cloathes both wollen and linnen, pitch, tarre, woad, flowre meale, wheate and rie, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as good pennie-worthes thereof as hee did before, as long as his ſtore-houſe had anie thing leaft in it. But not ſatiſfied here-with, hee togither with his Nephewe young <hi>Gilbert Vmfreuille</hi> Earle of <hi>Angius</hi> (but more commonlie called Lord of <hi>Kinne</hi>) entred the ſame yeare once againe into <hi>Scotland</hi> by land and ſpoiled the greater part of <hi>Tyuidale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it appeareth that at this time there was no peace betweene the two Nations, or elſe it was little reſpected on both ſides. For manie yeares after there was little doeing beetweene them. But now approached the ende of this Noble Prince who deceaſing in the fourth-teenth yeare of his raigne, in the yeare of our Lord 1412. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1412"/> leaft the Crowne vnto his Sonne <hi>Henry,</hi> Prince of <hi>Wailles,</hi> that was no leſſe inheritour to his heroycall vertues then to the ſame. In the ſecond yeare of his raigne it was propounded in Parliament, whether it were more meete to beginne with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>France</hi> (wherevnto hee pretended a iuſt title) or firſt to reduce <hi>Scotland</hi> to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obedience, for it was reſolued that the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:473:115"/> one or other ſhould forth-with be taken in hand. After long debate and conſultation vpon this point, it was concluded that the warre ſhould be commenced againſt the mightier enimie: for if <hi>France</hi> were once ſubdued, the <hi>Scottes</hi> were eaſily tamed, ſo that now they were at good leiſure either to bee lookers on, or actors on which ſide it pleaſed them. Neuertheleſſe whether it were that their Gouernour would not willingly incur King <hi>Henries</hi> diſpleaſure, fearing leaſt if he had ſtirred, hee would haue thruſt him out of place, by ſending the young King home, or whether that nation doubted, that by that occaſion the king would haue beene prouoked to ſet in foote for himſelfe, vnder colour of the defence of the your Prince his title, or elſe whatſoeuer it was that moued them therevnto, the <hi>Scottes</hi> made no great adoe during his raigne, though they were yet once againe prouoked by <hi>Vmfreuille,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put in truſt, at the Kings paſſage ouer into <hi>France,</hi> to gard the frontiers on that ſide, fought with them at <hi>Gedering,</hi> with three hundred Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and ſeauen ſcore men of armes, where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long fight, he ſlue aboue three ſcore of them, and tooke three hundred priſonere in chaſe, which was continued twelue miles, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Roxbrough</hi> Caſtle, whereof hee was Captaine. This conflict was on <hi>Mary Magdalines</hi> day, in the yeare 1414. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1414"/> Three yeares after, the <hi>Scottes</hi> made ſome ſhow of a purpoſe they had,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:473:115"/> to performe ſome great exploit, but vpon the approach of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> armie, they with-drew them-ſelues homeward without doing any great hurt. But although they ceaſed from further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance here, yet being entertained by the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> they oppoſed themſelues there againſt the <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> The <hi>Scottiſh</hi> writers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that ſeauen thouſand of them paſſed ouer together vnder the conduct of <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of <hi>Buchquhan,</hi> ſonne to their Gouernour, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Archibald Dowglas,</hi> and diuers other of good place. Vnto theſe men they do attribute the victory ouer the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> at the battaile of <hi>Baugie,</hi> fought on Eaſter-euen, in the yeare 1421. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1421"/> where the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> the Kings brother, giuing too much credit to a <hi>Lumbard,</hi> vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly ſet vpon the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> and <hi>Scottes,</hi> and was ſlaine, together with diuerſe other Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>England,</hi> in the whole to the number of ſome two thouſand. Of the aduerſe party were alſo ſlaine aboue twelue hundred, the beſt men of warre amongſt them. So as they had no great cauſe to boaſt of the victorie, how glorious ſo euer they make the ſame, affirming that for their good ſeruice at this time, the <hi>Dolphin</hi> beſtowed great honours and offices vpon them. The <hi>Scotts</hi> being thus animated againſt King <hi>Henry,</hi> at his next iourney into <hi>France</hi> (and the laſt he made) he tooke with him the Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to trie if happily they would be therby wone either to his
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:473:116"/> party, or at leaſt moued to returne home againe. But they ſo little regarded the matter, that being demanded why they would fight againſt their owne King, they anſwered; That they would not acknowledge any dutie to him, who as yet liued vnder the obedience of an other. Herewith (ſaith <hi>Buchanan</hi>) King <hi>Henry</hi> was ſo much diſpleaſed, that at the taking of <hi>Meaux</hi> in <hi>Bury,</hi> he cauſed 20. <hi>Scots</hi> to be executed, whom hee found there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had armed them-ſelues againſt their owne King. But I ſee not how it can be ſo, for the ſouldiours ſeeing themſelues vnable to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, abandoned the towne, and with-drawing their forces into the market place, fortified the ſame, which being afterwards ſurrendred vpon compoſition, the liues of poore men onely were excepted, namely baſtard <hi>Vauren</hi> the Captaine of the towne, the Baily, &amp; two Burgeſſes, all which vpon good conſideration were immediatly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and no other. When this moſt victorious Prince had ſo wonderfully preuailed in his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded conqueſt of <hi>France,</hi> as that within the terme of fiue or ſixe yeares, hee had brought the better part thereof vnder his obedience, it pleaſed the almighty God (the diſpoſer of kingdoms) to take him from thoſe earthly honours, to the fruition (I hope) of that endleſſe and incomparable glory prepared for them that are his, from the Prince to the Peaſant. He dyed in <hi>France</hi> in the 9. yeare of his raigne 1422. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1422"/> Hee left to ſucceed him his
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:473:116"/> onely child Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> about as many months old as his father had raigned yeares. Whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie was neuertheleſſe mightily ſupported, by the notable valiancie and policie of his two Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <hi>Humfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> to the one was committed the protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his perſon and kingdome, to the other the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of the warre continued in <hi>France.</hi> The death of the two kings comming together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two months one after the other, cauſed much alteration in the ſtate, wherein that nation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtood.

            <p>The Lord protector and the Nobilitie of the Land were heereby mooued, not onely vpon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie reaſonable conditions to ſet him at liberty,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:473:117"/> but alſo to yeeld him the fruition of her loue, which happily the Prince preferred, or at the leaſt equally ballanced with the ſame. Before his departure into <hi>Scotland,</hi> hee did homage to the young king of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtell, in the preſence of three Dukes, the two Archbiſhops, twelue Earles, ten Biſhops, twenty Barons, and two hundred Knights and Gentlemen, in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> I <hi>Iames Steward</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> ſhall be true and faithfull to you Lord <hi>Henry,</hi> by the grace of God King of <hi>England,</hi> and to you I make my fidelity for the ſame kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which I hold and claime of you. And I ſhall beare you my faith and fidelitie of life and limme, and worldly honour againſt all men. And faithfully I ſhall doe to you ſeruice for the kingdome of <hi>Scotland.</hi> So God me helpe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This done, King <hi>Iames</hi> with his Queene, were honorably attended and accompanied into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the yeare of grace 1423. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1423"/> But not-with-ſtanding this his ſolemne oath, his princely edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation here, and all the fauours hee had receiued, both at his departure, and during his captiuitie (if it may be ſo tearmed, whether it proceeded from a bad diſpoſition in himſelfe, or (as I rather take it) from the malice of his Nobilitie (who for the more part were <hi>French</hi> in affection) this Prince of all other ſhewed leaſt thankfulneſſe: for hauing forgotten the former courteſies, hee entred into matrimoniall alliance with <hi>France,</hi>

But ſithence hee faileth (as I take it) in the very foundation of that his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie, the frame which hee would thereon build, muſt of neceſſitie fall to the ground. For hee taketh it already granted, that the king of <hi>England</hi> did both violate his owne faith, and the lawes of all Nations, by detaining the Prince as his lawfull priſoner, vpon his arriuall here on the coaſt. But it is apparant enough (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue ſhewed) that either there was no truce at all betweene the two nations at that inſtant, or if there were, the ſame was notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie broken by the <hi>Scottes,</hi> in ioyning thoſe their ſo great forces, with the knowne enimies of this realme, againſt their lawfull Soueraigne, ſo farre within his owne kingdome. Admit all that was done without the priuitie of the King him-ſelfe.

            <p>The young Prince his ſonne, (<hi>Iames</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond) about ſeauen yeares olde at his fathers death, hauing raigned aboue twentie yeares, was ſlaine by misfortune at the ſiege of the ſame Caſtle, where the King his Father had knowledge firſt giuen him of the plotte of his finall deſtruction. In the meane time there was nothing of any importance paſſed betweene
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:473:119"/> the two nations, what was gotten by either party at one time, was loſt againe at another, after the manner of the mutabilitie of thoſe aduentures: happily there would haue beene more doings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, if the continuall troubles with their owne ſubiects, had not giuen both the kings their hands full at home.

For the effecting of this intended marriage, both the kings did ſend their Commiſſioners againe to <hi>Notingham,</hi> (where the former peace was alſo concluded) which was likewiſe there agreed vpon, and the aſſurance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed and ratified by hand and ſeale, and affian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made and taken by deputies on both ſides. The ſayd Lady was thence-forth called and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Princeſſe of <hi>Rothſay.</hi> But by occaſion of the death of king <hi>Richard</hi> (that was ſhortly after ſlaine at <hi>Boſworth</hi> field) ſhe inioyed that title but a while. During the time of truce, ſome queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did ariſe for the reſtitution of the Caſtell of <hi>Dumbar</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Albaine</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on king <hi>Edward,</hi> as is afore-ſaid, but king <hi>Richard</hi> gaue ſo good words that, while hee liued he held the ſame. Neuertheleſſe before king <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſeauenth was fullie ſetled, the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> king layed ſiedge againſt it with ſuch egerneſſe, as that the defendantes diſpayring of anie aide in conuenient time out of <hi>England,</hi> in ſo turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a ſeaſon, gaue it vp, not without ſuſpition (it is ſayd) of treaſon. This <hi>Henry</hi> hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatly ſubdewed the tirant in the field, and thereby attained the Crowne in the yeare 1485. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1485"/> fought principallie to eſtabliſh his eſtate by
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:473:126"/> alliance and lawes at home, and then by league and amity with his neighbour the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> King. By his marriage with the Ladie <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (the eldeſt Daughter of king <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth) the two houſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> which had for many yeares before contended for the Soueraignty, were gratiouſly vnited in the iſſue, that did ſpring from them two, vpon whom, for the auoyding of all titles and claimes (peramount) in time to come the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> by generall conſent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the three eſtates, was limited and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayled, as in that ſtatute at large may appeare. As for the renewing of the league with <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> king <hi>Iames</hi> was as readie to imbrace peace, as the other was to offer it, hoping thereby more ſafely to proſecute his long deſired reuenge vpon diuerſe of the Nobilitie, that had highlie (but I knowe not how worthilie) incurred his diſpleaſure, which thing ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie after turned to his owne deſtruction. For hauing vnaduiſedlie ioyned battaile with his aduerſaries at <hi>Bannockſburne,</hi> with in two miles of <hi>Sterling,</hi> hee was finallie put to flight and purſued vnto death. This came to paſſe in the yeare 1488. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1488"/> King <hi>Henrie</hi> at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie had ſent to his aide fiue tall ſhippes of warre, which with the reſt of his expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuccours (thorough his owne ouer much haſt) came all too late to do him anie ſeruice.</p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:473:126"/>
            <p>Theſe Shippes (ſaieth <hi>Buchanan</hi>) lying againſt <hi>Dumbar,</hi> were ſet vpon by two <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Shippes, conducted by <hi>Andrewe Woode,</hi> and by force were taken and brought to <hi>Leith.</hi> But I doubt much of the truth hereof, for, neither is it likely, that the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> would yeelde without ſome loſſe of bloud (whereof there is no mention) or that two <hi>Scottiſh</hi> ſhippes could bee able ſo eaſilie to ſubdewe fiue ſuch <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as (no doubte) were eſpeciallie choſen for that ſeruice, when as not long after (as hee himſelfe confeſſeth) three other indured ſo long a fight againſt them. Wherefore I rather thinke, that thoſe fiue ſhippes were by ſome ſtratage<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deceaued by the ſaid <hi>Andrew:</hi> for, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer afterwards hee was drawne from that ſide, it was not vnknowne to the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> that the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> King (while hee liued) repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch truſt in him; as that he was made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ouer his nauie, and conſequentlie a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of their owne fortunes, beeing all come thyther to aſſiſt the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> king. But bee it as it may bee, I muſt needes commend the young Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for returning home <hi>Bull</hi> and his companions without ranſome or rebuke, who in the latter conflict with <hi>Wood,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended more for glory, then vpon hope of gaine to be gotten therby. For the tearme of 7. yeares, from the death of <hi>Iames</hi> the third, while the truce betweene the two Nations continewed,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:473:127"/> peace was embraced on both ſides. In the meane time it was deuiſed by the Ladie <hi>Margaret,</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe of <hi>Burgoigne,</hi> who greatly enuied the proſperity of king <hi>Henry,</hi> onely becauſe he was deſcended of the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> family, an ancient enemy to her line, that one <hi>Peter Marbecke</hi> borne at <hi>Tornay</hi> of baſe parentage, but by her trained vp and inſtructed for that purpoſe, ſhould take vpon him the perſon of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> ſecond Sonne to her brother king <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, who togither with his brother were murthered in the Towre, as before I haue ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. This ioylie youth, hauing firſt aſſaied, what entertainment hee might finde in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> (which fell not out to his liking) tranſported himſelfe at length into <hi>Scotland,</hi> hoping there, by reaſon of the want of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the young king (<hi>Iames</hi> the fourth) and the too great forwardneſſe of his people to quarrell with <hi>England,</hi> to finde that Nation more pliable to his deſignments, which came to paſſe accordingly. For hauing firſt priuatlie to the king, and after that in a publique aſſemblie, made knowne what perſon he pretended to be, and with all the ſkill he had, allured both Prince and people to a commiſeration of his miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: whether it were that they were mooued by an ouer-light beliefe in pitie, or a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit credulity in policie, his complaint ſo much preuailed with the greater number, that it was
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:473:127"/> held a matter of great reproche, not to ioyne with him in the attaining of the Crowne of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where-vnto hee pretended ſo iuſt a title. Forth-with king <hi>Iames</hi> cauſed him to bee called the Duke of <hi>Yorke.</hi> And for a further fauour, to giue him the more courage, and his cauſe the more credit, hee gaue him in mariage the Lady <hi>Katherine Gordon,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Alexander</hi> Earle of <hi>Huntley,</hi> his nigh kinſman, whoſe beauty better beſeemed her birth, then ſuch a Bride-groome. King <hi>Iames</hi> hauing prepared all things fit for the enterprice, entred into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> cauſing proclamation to be made, that he would fauor all thoſe that would ſubmit themſelues to this new created Duke, but finding none that would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or acknowledge any ſuch ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the <hi>Scots</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all to the furie of fire and ſword. Hereby hauing well neere waſted the whole countrey, they returned home, inriched with many good booties, before an armie could be made ready to incounter them. King <hi>Henry</hi> being not a little moued, purpoſed the next ſpring to be reuenged, but euen as the army was marching towards <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> vnder the conduct of the Lord <hi>Daubiney,</hi> it was ſodenly called backe againe, by occaſion of a commotion begun by the <hi>Corniſh-men,</hi> ſo as for that time the intended iourney was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> hauing his Armie alſo in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ouer-ſlipped not the opportunitie, but
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:473:128"/> while king <hi>Henry</hi> was buſied about the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this rebellion in the Weſt parts, hee inuaded his dominions on the North. For de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding his Armie, he himſelfe with a part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of beſiedged the Caſtell of <hi>Norham,</hi> while the reſt forrayed the countrie there-about. <hi>Richard Fox</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> (to whome the Caſtle appertained,) aduertiſing king <hi>Henry</hi> hereof, the Earle of <hi>Surrie</hi> (that was then in readineſſe, vpon any occaſion offered to be imployed) was commanded with all ſpeed to relieue the ſame.

            <p>Thus was king <hi>Henry</hi> ſet on worke at home, as well by his owne ſubiects on the one ſide, as by the <hi>Scottes</hi> on the other. But hee did ſo warily foreſee all dangers, that he eaſily preuented the malice of them both. For the <hi>Corniſhmen</hi> were defeited at the battaile of <hi>Black-heath-field,</hi> and the <hi>Scottes</hi> at the approach of the Earle gaue ouer the ſiedge, and returned home as lightly laden as when they came thence. The Armie beeing come by this time within two dayes marche of the enimies, made all the haſt that could bee, to haue ouer-taken them, but ſeeing they would not abide, the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> made what ſpoile they could within <hi>Scotland,</hi> where hauing taken their pleaſures for the ſpace of ſixe or ſeauen dayes, they returned to <hi>Berwicke</hi> with-out any ſhew of reſiſtance, although that at the taking of the Caſtell of <hi>Hayton</hi> (it is ſaid) the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Armie was within one mile of the <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was king <hi>Henrie</hi> ſufficiently reuenged on the <hi>Scottes,</hi> that were ſo ready to take part with <hi>Perkin</hi> the counterfeit Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> who now had apparently enough ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the world, as that which followed ſhortly after ſhewed. For vpon a treatie of truce betweene the two Nations, vndertaken and effected by <hi>Peter Hiolas</hi> an Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spaine,</hi> king <hi>Iames</hi> was contented, for the furtherance thereof, to ſend the other <hi>Peter</hi>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:473:129"/> packing out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſeeke new intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſome-where elſe, where he was not ſo well knowne. But this aduenturous Gallant once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine attempting to trie ſome maiſteries here in <hi>England,</hi> was vtterly forſaken of all his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, where-vpon for his more ſafetie, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his perſon firſt to Sanctuary, and from thence ſubmitted him-ſelfe to the Kings mercy, who appointed a gard to attend him, from whom eſcaping, hee was recouered, and committed to the Towre of London, where practiſing an eſcape, hee was finally for his ſeuerall offences executed at Tyburne, as hee well deſerued. The poore Lady his vnfortunate wife, being in the meane time taken and preſented to the King: his Maieſtie tooke ſuch compaſſion on her pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull eſtate, that hee gaue order ſhee ſhould bee carefully conuayed to the Queene his wife, of whome ſhee was courteouſlie intertained, and remained in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court a long time after in good eſtimation.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> well foreſeeing what benefit it would be vnto him, if by any good meanes a firme peace and amitie with <hi>England,</hi> might bee obteined, tooke occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now in the time of truce to ſend for the Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> who was ſhortly after admitted by king <hi>Henry</hi> to repaire into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Beeing come to the kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, after much friendly ſpeach, hee made knowne vnto him, his great deſire to confirme a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:473:129"/> perfect peace and vnitie with <hi>England,</hi> by take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wife the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the king his Maiſter. The Biſhop willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed his beſt indeuour to bring the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to paſſe, which about three yeares after, was effected accordingly, not-with-ſtanding that in the meane ſeaſon, Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> the kings eldeſt ſonne deceaſing, Prince <hi>Henry</hi> his brother remained onely a barre betweene her and the Crowne. True it is, that this Ladye was affianced, and by proxie contracted to the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> king, while Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> yet liued, about ſixe weekes after his marriage with the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Neuer-the-leſſe if king <hi>Henry</hi> had beene diſpoſed (vpon his ſonnes death) to haue broken and auoyded the ſame, it had beene no difficult point for him to haue preuailed ſo much with the Pope, who not long after diſpenced in a matter of greater of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, with the marriage (I meane) of king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight with the ſaid Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> his brothers wife. It is reported by <hi>Morgan,</hi> that when the king of <hi>Englands</hi> Councell began to fore-caſt ſome perill in this match with <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Maieſtie vpon good aduiſe anſwered, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that thing ſhould come to paſſe hereby, which they ſeemed to ſtand in doubt of, namely, the intitling of king <hi>Iames</hi> and his poſteritie to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> hee ſo little diſtruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that any inconuenience ſhould inſue thereof
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:473:130"/> vnto this realme, as that for his part he thought nothing could happen more gratious to both nations: which by that meane ſhould be vnited and made one Monarchie. And further that <hi>Scotland</hi> being much inferior in quantitie and qualitie vnto <hi>England,</hi> ſhould bee therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and held but a dependence on it, as <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie</hi> was at the time of the Conqueſt. And laſtlie when that ſhould come to paſſe, hee that by this mariage ſhould be heire to both king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, would in his ſtile of regalitie preferre <hi>England</hi> before the other. This was the ninth time, that ſince the conqueſt, the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Kings haue married with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; and for the more part with the bloud royall, from all which ſome iſſue hath ſprung, two onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For firſt, <hi>Malcolme Cammoire</hi> king of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> married <hi>Margaret,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> whoſe ſonne king <hi>Dauid,</hi> married <hi>Mawde</hi> the Daughter and heire of <hi>Waltheolfe</hi> Earle of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> whoſe ſonne Prince <hi>Henry</hi> maried a Daughter of Earle <hi>Warham,</hi> whoſe ſonne king <hi>William,</hi> married the Lady <hi>Ermangard,</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Richard</hi> Vicount <hi>Beaumont,</hi> who was ſonne to a Daughter of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the ſecond, their ſonne, married the Lady <hi>Iane,</hi> Siſter to King <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſecond, but had no iſſue by her. <hi>Alexander</hi> the third his ſonne, married <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, whoſe poſteritie ended in <hi>Margaret</hi> their
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:473:130"/> grand-child, the heire of <hi>Norway.</hi> After this, <hi>Dauid Bruſe</hi> (whoſe great Grand-mother was Daughter to <hi>Hugh Bohume</hi> Earle of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and wife to <hi>Dauid</hi> brother to King <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) maried <hi>Iane,</hi> Siſter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, but hee dyed with-out iſſue, where-vpon the crowne of <hi>Scotland</hi> deſcended vnto the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ancient familie of the <hi>Stewards,</hi> the third king whereof (<hi>Iames</hi> the firſt) maried the Lady <hi>Iane,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> which <hi>Iames</hi> was great Grand-father to this <hi>Iames,</hi> who now laſt of all maried the eldeſt Daughter of this King <hi>Henry,</hi> from whom <hi>Iames</hi> the ſixt now King is lineally deſcended in the third degree, both by Father and Mother.</p>
            <p>Though in the meane time, none of our Kings haue maried with <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſaue onely King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the firſt, whereby the Crowne returned to the <hi>Saxon</hi> bloud (as hath beene declared) yet diuers of our Nobilitie haue matched in the bloud royall of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Hereby it appeareth how much that Nation hath alwayes ſought to ſtrengthen it ſelfe, by alliance with <hi>England,</hi> though <hi>France</hi> hath of late ſo much preuailed, that therein it hath beene preferred before vs, but with no very good ſucceſſe, as the ſequell declareth. During the life of King <hi>Henry</hi> (which was within two months of ſixe yeares after this marriage) no occaſion of quarrell was offered on either part, but all loue and kindneſſe, that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:473:131"/> might bee deſired, paſſed betweene the two Kings. Neither did king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight (that ſucceeded his Father) giue his brother in lawe king <hi>Iames,</hi> anie iuſt occaſion to breake friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe with him, but it ſeemeth the ſame wholy proceeded from the ſubtile practiſe of <hi>France</hi> our ancient enemie, as many times before, that Nation had done the like, for it hath beene euer their policie to ſowe diſſention betweene <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the end they might ſet the king of <hi>England</hi> on worke at home, fearing hee would otherwiſe be too buſie with them. This <hi>Henrie</hi> hauing with great felicity raigned neere foure and twenty yeares, leaft behinde him vnto his Sonne king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, ſo aſſured and ſetled a kingdome, and withall ſuch aboundance of treaſure, as neuer any of his predeceſſours did the like before him. He died in the yeare of our redemption 1509. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1509"/> In the third yeare of this laſt king <hi>Henries</hi> raigne, it fell out that <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> king made ſharpe warre on Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> in <hi>Ittalie,</hi> wherevpon thorough the ſolicitation of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> king of <hi>Spaine</hi> (whoſe Daughter king <hi>Henrie</hi> had married, by diſpenſation from that martiall Prelate) hee was eaſilie drawne to ioyne with them in the Popes behalfe. King <hi>Iames</hi> hauing not long before receiued manie fauoures of the <hi>French</hi> King, and amongſt the reſt, two ſhippes fraught with gunnes, ſpeares and all other kinde
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:473:131"/> of munition for warre, (a good preparatiue to the practiſe following) was thereby made more inclinable to the <hi>French</hi> faction. And for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpurre therevnto, diuerſe of his clergie, who had likewiſe taſted of the liberality of king <hi>Lewis,</hi> ſought all occaſiones where-by to prick him forward in that courſe. This could not be compaſſed, till ſuch time as they had firſt aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him wholie from his former affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>England.</hi> To which end the Biſhoppe of <hi>Murrey</hi> (a priuie man of that faction) was ſent to King <hi>Henrie,</hi> now well-nere after nine yeares ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, to demand a certaine pretious veſtement, and rich attire, which (as was pretended) was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queene by her brother Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> at his death. King <hi>Henry</hi> diſtruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome ſubtilty herein, to the end hee would preuent all occaſion of vnkindneſſe, anſwered, that the king his brother ſhould not onely haue at his hands, that which was dewe, but elſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he deſired of him. The Biſhoppe with this anſwere (which was better happelie then he either wiſhed or exſpected) returned home. But howſoeuer King <hi>Iames</hi> regarded the meſſage, this Biſhoppe was forth-with ſent into <hi>France,</hi> and after him certaine ſhippes well appointed for ſeruice, which not long before had beene prepared (as was giuen out) to tranſport the king into <hi>Siria</hi> againſt the infidelles.

Such was the end of this vnfortunate Prince, in nothing more vnfortunate, then in that hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with his owne good fortune. For if he had continued conſtant to king <hi>Henry,</hi> he might haue liued many yeares in as great felicity, as euer any of his predeceſſors did before him. Round about him died with the like obſtinacie, many of his chiefe Prelates, namely the Archbiſhop of Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and two other Biſhops, beſides foure Abbots, and of Lords and men of ſpeciall note aboue ſix and thirtie. The whole number of <hi>Scots</hi> ſlaine at this battaile, could in all likelyhood, bee no leſſe then ten thouſand, conſidering the loſſe of ſo many leaders amongſt them: and the ſmall number of them that were taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; amongſt whom there were but two of name, Sir <hi>William Scotte</hi> Chancelour to the king, and Sir <hi>Iohn Forman</hi> his Sergiant Porter. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other peeces of great ordinance taken at this time, there were ſeauen Culuerings of like ſiſe and making, called the Seauen Siſters. This famous ouerthrow was giuen the <hi>Scottes</hi> in September in the yeare 1513. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1513"/> and that within the ſpace of little more then three houres, which happily would haue prooued more bloudie on both ſides, had not the night taken vp the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:473:136"/> Of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were ſlaine (as <hi>Hall</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) about ſome fifteene hundred: diuers were taken priſoners by following the <hi>Scottes</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egerly in the chaſe, after day-light was done. It was not well knowne on which ſide the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was falne, vntill the next morning, for then the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> with his troopes of horſemen, being ſent abroad to view the behauiour of the <hi>Scottes,</hi> found they had forſaken their artillarie, and left the field. The Kings body being found, many deepe and deadly wounds appeared on the ſame, which the Earle of <hi>Surrey</hi> cauſed to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowelled and ſeared, wherewith (hauing ſet all things in good order) he returned to the Queene of <hi>England.</hi> In memory of this notable victorie ouer that nation, his family hath hitherto borne in their Scutchions the armes of <hi>Scotland</hi> for an addition of Honor thervnto, but with what right I know not. Amongſt other prodigious ſignes, immediatly fore-going this bloud-ſhed, <hi>Buchana<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> recordeth one very memorable, receiued from the report of him that was an eye witneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, a man of ſpeciall credit with him. This it was: King <hi>Iames</hi> going to his armie, now ready to ſet forward, entred into a Chappell that was in his way to heare euen-ſong (as then it was called): while hee was at his deuotion, an ancient man came in, bare-headed, his golden coloured locks hanging downe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſhoulders, his fore-head high, and inclining to baldneſſe, his garments of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:473:137"/> Azure coulour ſome-what long, girded about him with a Towell or table Napkin, of a comelie and reuerend countenance. Hauing inquired for the king, hee intruded himſelfe into the preaſe, paſſing thorow till hee came to him: then lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon the Kings ſeate, he thus ſpake, after a good, plaine, and familier maner. Sir King, I am ſent to admoniſh thee to proceed no further in this thy intended iourney: which aduiſe if thou dooſt refuſe to follow, it will be worſſe for thee and them that attend thee therein. I am fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charged to warne thee, not to vſe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, companie, or counſell of women, for if thou doe otherwiſe, it will turne to thy loſſe and diſhonour. This being ſaid, hee with-drew him-ſelfe backe againe into the preaſe. When ſeruice was ended, the king inquired earneſtly for him, but hee could no where bee found, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could any of the ſtanders by (of whom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe did narowlie obſerue him, meaning after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to haue queſtioned further with him) feele or perceiue how, or when hee paſſed from them. Queene <hi>Margaret,</hi> after the death of her husband challenged the protection of the realme, as the king by his laſt Will and Teſtament diſpoſed the ſame, ſo long as ſhee continued a widow. Being therein eſtabliſhed, firſt of all ſhe wrote to king <hi>Henry</hi> her brother, intreating him not onely to ceaſe from purſuing warre further vpon <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (beeing euen then at warre with it ſelfe)
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:473:137"/> but alſo to bee a defence vnto her and the infant her ſonne (not much aboue a yeare old) againſt all ſuch, as happily would oppoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt her. Here-vnto King <hi>Henry</hi> anſwered, that with the peaceable hee would haue peace, but to the froward &amp; ſeditious he would be an enemy. Not long after Queene <hi>Margaret,</hi> hauing maried <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chibald Dowglas,</hi> (the prime and choiſe man amongſt all the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> nobility) the realme began to be deuided into two mighty factions. They of the <hi>Dowglaſsian</hi> party would haue the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t continued in the Queene, becauſe thereby the realme ſhould ſtill haue peace with <hi>England,</hi> which at that ſeaſon was a point very neceſſarily to be reſpected. The aduerſe party (of whom the Lord <hi>Hume</hi> was the principall man) pretending an ancient cuſtome in that caſe, importuned the election of <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Albanie,</hi> ſonne to the former Duke <hi>Alexander.</hi> This gentleman for the moſt part had liued before in <hi>France,</hi> and was wholy deuoted to the ſeruice of King <hi>Francis,</hi> who to bind him the faſter vnto him, had dealt very honorably with him at his departure into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Immediatly vpon his arriuall, great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention aroſe betwixt him and others of the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Nobility, but eſpecially the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> who (as before I haue touched) was the chiefe meane of his preferment to that place. Queene <hi>Margaret</hi> much fearing the iſſue hereof, together with her husband, and ſome other of that faction, for her
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:473:138"/> more ſafely repaired into <hi>England.</hi> During her abode there, ſhe was deliuered at <hi>Herbottle,</hi> of a Daughter, the Lady <hi>Margaret Dowglas,</hi> grand-mother to King <hi>Iames</hi> the ſixt, now king by his father, as her brother, King <hi>Iames</hi> the fift was his grand-father by his mother. So as his Father and Mother, were the children of brother and ſiſter, namely of <hi>Iames</hi> the fift, and this Lady <hi>Margret</hi> his halfe ſiſter. But the new Regent the Duke of <hi>Albanie,</hi> ſo excuſed himſelfe by Ambaſſage to the king of <hi>England</hi> in that point, that within a yeare after, the Queene returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> honorably attended, and richly appointed of all things fit for her eſtate. The Earle <hi>Dowglas</hi> her husband (who in the meane ſeaſon had obtained the Regents fauour) receiued her at <hi>Berwicke,</hi> and from thence did accompanie her home. All quarrels in the meane time being well appeaſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Regent paſſed ouer into <hi>France,</hi> committing the yong Prince (together with the gouernment of the realme) in his abſence to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Nobilitie, but aboue all the reſt, hee repoſed moſt truſt in a <hi>Frenchman</hi> named <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Darcie,</hi> Captaine of the Caſtell of <hi>Dunbarre,</hi> whom he ioyned in commiſſion with the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lords, to the end he might giue him intelligence of all their proceedings in his abſence. It was this mans hap ſoone after to be ſlaine by the <hi>Scots,</hi> &amp; for more deſpite, to haue his head ſtroken off, and ſet vpon <hi>Hume</hi> Caſtell, to the view of all that
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:473:138"/> paſſed by. This outrage was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the twelfe of September, in the yeare 1517. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1517"/> which gaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to ſome new broiles amongſt them. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the abſence of the Duke, the <hi>Dowglaſsian</hi> faction bare greateſt ſway, for the continuance whereof, king <hi>Henry</hi> laboured the <hi>French</hi> King to keepe the Duke ſtill with him: neuer-the-leſſe by reaſon of ſome trouble likely to ariſe betweene <hi>France</hi> &amp; <hi>England,</hi> the Regent returned into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> about fiue yeares after his departure thence, with a purpoſe to abate the ouer-great powre of the <hi>Dowglas.</hi> Immediatly herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Gawen Dowglas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dunkell</hi> (a very reuerend man) came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi> &amp; informed the king, how great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary the Regent was to his whole family, and that he alone had taken on him the cuſtody of the yong king, the ſequell whereof hee much feared. This Biſhop died ſhortly after at London, &amp; was buried in the <hi>Sauoy church.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> vpon this complaint, ſent <hi>Clarentius</hi> (king at Armes) into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to admoniſh the Duke to auoide the country, according to the Articles agreed vpon the ſummer before, in the laſt truce take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the <hi>French</hi> king; for the king held it very vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inconuenient, to admit him ſole <hi>Gardian</hi> ouer the yong Prince, that was next heire after him to the Crowne, leaſt happily by ſuch oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity he might be tempted to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit the like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural cruelty, which ſome haue done in the like caſe both in <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</hi> That therfore the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:473:139"/> king his maiſter (ſaid <hi>Clarentius</hi>) had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prouide for the ſafty of his nephew, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee could no way bee better aſſured, then by keeping him from that place and authority in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But of all theſe threats the Regent ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make light account. Now began the <hi>French</hi> king to quarrell againe with king <hi>Henry,</hi> before the truce was fully expired, where-vpon all the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> that then inhabited in <hi>London</hi> and other places of the realme, were put to their fines, and a ſtrong Nauie was forth-with ſent to the Sea vnder the conduct of Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams</hi> Vice-admirall, and ſeauen other were at the ſame time ſent alſo againſt <hi>Scotland,</hi> the which entring into the <hi>Furth,</hi> ſet fire on diuerſe <hi>Scottiſh</hi> ſhips, and ſo returned with their priſoners into <hi>England.</hi> The ſame yeare the Lord <hi>Roſſe</hi> and the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> of the North, who were appointed to keepe the borders, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred alſo with their forces into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and burnt the towne of <hi>Kelſoe,</hi> beſides many other villages, ouer-threw ſundry holdes and piles of ſtone, and then returned home with their boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Regent being here-with prouoked to reuenge, raiſed a great powre, where-with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the Marches, he fully purpoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade <hi>England.</hi> But whether it were, that hee thought himſelfe ouer-weake, to incounter the <hi>Engliſh</hi> armie, that was comming on apace vnder the conduct of the Earle of <hi>Shrewsburie,</hi> or that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:473:139"/> hee ſtood not well aſſured of ſome of his owne company (which was more likely) he was well contented to harken vnto peace, ſo that a truce was taken for ſome few monthes, and then with no little ſtaine to his reputation he turned back-againe. In October following, the Duke paſſed ouer againe into <hi>France,</hi> promiſing his fauori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that if a peace were not in the meane time concluded with <hi>England,</hi> hee would bring the next Sommer ſuch a warlike crewe of <hi>Frenchmen</hi> and <hi>Germanes,</hi> as that he ſhould not ſtand in neede of ſuch of his owne Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as were ſo backe-ward in his former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprice vpon the borders. In the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, King <hi>Henry</hi> thought it no policy to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlip ſo fit oportunity, becauſe he well percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that whatſoeuer was outwardly pretended, the Regent meant him no good. So ſoone therefore as the truce was expired, the warre was renewed to the exceeding great damage of that Nation. For <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Surrey</hi> high Admirall of <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Marqueſſe Dorſet</hi> and his brothers with a competent power entring into <hi>Scotland,</hi> ouerthrewe the Caſtells of <hi>Weder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne, Weſt Neſgate</hi> and <hi>Black-acre,</hi> burned neere fortie townes and villages, in which manner waſting the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Marches from one ſide to the other, without any reſiſtance, they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home with the loſſe of verie fewe or no men at all, the <hi>Scottes</hi> onelie ſhewed them-ſelues
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:473:140"/> in troopes a far of, watching if they could haue eſpied any aduantage. This ſeruice was thus performed the Sommer following, in the yeare 1523. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1523"/> But the army was no ſooner diſſolued, but the <hi>Scots</hi> waiting the opportunity, made conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal roades into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> to the great anoiance of the inhabitants. Wherefore the Earle of <hi>Surrey</hi> was forth-with ſent back againe, who entring into <hi>Scotland</hi> with ſome ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men by the dry marches, caſt downe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Caſtells, piles and ſmall holdes, til he came thorowe the dales to <hi>Iedworth:</hi> wherein laie a great garriſon of the <hi>Scottes,</hi> who at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained them with a hot ſkermiſh, but in the end they were put to flight, and the Town, Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell and Abbaie were taken and ſpoiled. After three daies abode there, the Earle returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi> on the twentith day of September following.</p>
            <p>About this time, the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> tooke alſo by force the Caſtell of <hi>Ferniherſt.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Albanie</hi> intending now to returne into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had intelligence giuen him, that all the portes on the Coaſt of <hi>France</hi> were watched by the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> to intrappe him in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, wherefore hee beſtowed his ſhippes, ſo couertly here and there in ſmall companies, to auoide all ſuſpition, of any purpoſe hee had to ſtirre that yeare, as that therevpon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fleete, which had attended and waited his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:473:140"/> forth, vntill the middeſt of Auguſt, brake vp and beſtowed themſelues in conuenient portes againſt the next ſpring. The Duke then watching the opportunity, and readily gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring togither his diſperſed ſhippes, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſome fiftie ſaile, imbarked his men of warre, being three thouſand pikes, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred launces, and about the ſecond equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall arriued on the VVeſt part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame ſeaſon that <hi>Iedworth</hi> was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as is a fore-ſayd, in whoſe companie was <hi>Richard de la Poole,</hi> that had beene baniſhed out of <hi>England.</hi> Immediatlie after his returne hee aſſembled the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lordes at <hi>Edenbrugh,</hi> declaring to them the great loue the <hi>French</hi> King bare to them and there Country, that he eſteemed their miſeries his owne, and would be alwaies readie to aſſiſt them againſt the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> enemies to them both. That for the preſent he had brought with him men, money and munition to bee doing withall, ſo as nothing now wanted but willing mindes and manly corages in themſelues. In the ende it was concluded that an army ſhould forth-with be gathered, and the eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith day of October next was ſet downe for their meeting at <hi>Dowglas</hi> dale.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scottes</hi> being there aſſembled, at the day prefixed, the army marched fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to <hi>Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreame</hi> vpon <hi>Tweed,</hi> where conuaying their
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:473:141"/> artillary ouer the water, on the laſt day of the ſame month they layed ſiedge to <hi>Warke</hi> Caſtell, which was manfully defended by Sir <hi>William Liſle</hi> Captaine of the ſame. The aſſayliants ſo well beſtirred themſelues, that on the firſt daie they won the vttermoſt ward, for two daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they continewed the battery, when hauing made the breach aſſaultable, they entred by maine force the ſecond ward. The Captaine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing already loſt many of his men, and percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it little auailed to defend the walles againſt the great ordinance, vpon a preſent reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on iſſued out with his people that remained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, and with ſuch furie repulſed the enemy, that beating them from the walles, and purſuing them to the water, he ſlewe a great number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe that were drowned, and died after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of their hurtes; in the whole to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of three hundred, which for the moſt part were <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> The Earle of <hi>Surrey</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with a great power to reſcue this Caſtell, found the enemie remooued to the further ſide of the riuer, wherefore hauing no commiſſion to paſſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> marches, he ſtaied there. In the meane time the Queene ſent into <hi>England</hi> to entreat her brother the King, to yeeld to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence of warre, hoping in that time to worke ſome good agreement betweene the two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherevnto the King conſenting, the armie brake vp and the Earle returned to the Court.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:473:141"/> In the beginning of the next Sommer anno. 1524. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1524"/> The <hi>Scottes</hi> beganne againe to bee buſie both on the Eaſt and VVeſt marches, ſo as for three monthes ſundrie bickrings paſſed bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the one and other partie, but ſtill they came by the worſe, in ſo much that in the end they were willing enough to encline to peace: wherevpon truce was taken againe till the feaſt of Saint Andrewes next. In the meane ſeaſon great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultation was had amongſt the Lords of <hi>Scotland</hi> whether it were more fit to contineue the warre, or to giue it ouer. Many of them held it an vnreaſonable thing, that for the pleaſure only of the <hi>French</hi> King, the Realme ſhould ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any more damage, by contineuing ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a warre, and that the Duke was much to blame in yeelding ſo farre to the ſeditious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of <hi>France.</hi> Therefore they wiſhed, that the young King (now growne paſt a Child) might at the leaſt beare ſome ſway in the gouernment of the Realme. The Duke perceiuing how the game went, ſawe it little auailed to ſtriue againſt the ſtreame, and therefore in September follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, taking his leaue of the young King, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ouer into <hi>France,</hi> now the third time ſince he was made Regent. It is ſayd, that at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; hee did inſtantly intreate the Nobility to admit no peace with <hi>England</hi> till his returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which he promiſed ſhould be not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but in both his deſire was vnſatiſfied, for he
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:473:142"/> neuer came more into <hi>Scotland</hi> neither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the war as he wiſhed. Shortly after the Earle <hi>Dowglas,</hi> that had beene baniſhed before by the Regent (as I haue ſaid) and had hitherto remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>France,</hi> obtained leaue of King <hi>Henrie</hi> to paſſe ſafely thorowe <hi>England</hi> into his owne Country. This fauor was redily graunted, being one that was alwaies oppoſite to the <hi>French</hi> fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Queene <hi>Margaret,</hi> now bearing the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſway in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſought by all meanes how to make firme friendſhip with her brother of <hi>England</hi> &amp; to breake the necke of the amity with <hi>France,</hi> which had of late brought ſo many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries vpon her Sonnes kingdome. Neither did King <hi>Henry</hi> forget by kind letters and meſſages, to diuerſe of that nation, to ſecond therein his Siſters deſignements, ſignifying vnto them that he deſired nothing more then perpetuall loue and concord betweene the two Neighbor Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which thing as he had euer before wiſhed, yet much more at this time, to the end all men might ſee how much hee tendred the ſtate of their Reamle, for the young kings ſake his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew. That if they would be perſwaded to break of friendſhip with <hi>France,</hi> he could finde in his heart to beſtow the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> (his only Child) in marriage vpon their King, whereby the two kingdomes ſhould bee in great poſſibility to be made one Monarchy, and that by the acceſſe of <hi>England</hi> vnto <hi>Scotland:</hi> which would be the more
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:473:142"/> honor to their nation. That the like emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; malice hath bin heretofore known, betweene the like neighbor countries, which neuertheleſſe by mariage, entercourſe, trafique, &amp; mutual kindnes hath bin vtterly ſuppreſſed &amp; buried in obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe exceeding kind offers of King <hi>Henry,</hi> moued much debate, &amp; argument at an aſſembly of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lords amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. On the one ſide it was obiected, that as <hi>France</hi> was farre remooued by ſcituation from them, ſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple differed much from the <hi>Scottes</hi> in the whole courſe and manner of life. But the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and they were bred and brought vp vnder one and the ſame climate, and were ſo like in there language, lawes, manners, cuſtomes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, conſtitution of bodie, and diſpoſition of minde (wherein ſocietie eſpecially conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) that it ſeemed God and Nature had from the beginning purpoſed to make them one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culier people, as they hade made there ſeate one ſoile, by it ſelfe, ſeuered from the maine conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:473:143"/> of the Ocean, which either by furie of tempeſts may be hindered, or by the enemy fore-ſtawled and clogged. VVhereof was made good proofe not much aboue a yeare ago, when as the Duke of <hi>Albanie</hi> was ſo pend vp in <hi>France</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nauie, that of al one whole Sommer they could receiue no ſuccors from thence, to their exceeding loſſe and diſcontentment. Thus much was then alledged in fauour of the league with <hi>England,</hi> whervnto not a few amongſt them were well inclined, though many other, that either li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vpon rapine and ſpoile (which alwaies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth war,) or that were fed afore-hand by the <hi>French</hi> king (which courſe hath euer much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed with that Nation) obſtinatly oppoſed themſelues againſt this profitable and ſound aduiſe.</p>
            <p>But being not able by any ſhow of reaſon to maintaine their friuolous allegations againſt the truth, they ſubtilly brake of this conference, with this caution, that this weighty point could not be reſolued without the general conſent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Eſtates aſſembled to that end. For they were well aſſured that the Duke (to whom eſpecially the deciding of this queſtion pertained) would neuer giue conſent to ſhake hands with <hi>England,</hi> notwithſtanding Queene <hi>Margaret</hi> ſo labored this point, for the benefit (ſhe knew) would therof come to her Sonne and his kingdom, that in December following ſhee
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:473:143"/> ſent the Lord <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earle of <hi>Caſſels, Robert Cockburne</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dunkeld,</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Combuskeneth</hi> Ambaſſadours into <hi>England,</hi> who comming to the Court on Chriſtmaſſe eue, the King gaue them audience, to whom the Biſhop made an eloquent Oration in Latine, declaring the benefits of peace, and the manifold diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of warre. How happy a thing it were, if by the marriage of their young King with the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> his Maieſties Daughter, a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all league and alliance might bee eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. The King liked well of this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo as hee might obtaine his deſire in two points. Firſt and eſpecially, that the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility would renounce the league with <hi>France:</hi> Secondly, that the young king his Nephew, would come and remaine with him in <hi>England,</hi> till he were of perfect age to marry his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But becauſe the Ambaſſadors had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to proceede ſo farre, the Earle returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to acquaint the Queene and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell there-with. The two other remained at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don till his returne thither againe. Here-vpon a Parliament was preſently holden at <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> from whence the Earle of <hi>Caſſels</hi> was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſent againe to the King of <hi>England,</hi> with a fauourable anſwer to his two former demands. But becauſe that in the meane ſeaſon <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour renewed his former ſute for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the ſayd Lady to his wife, the King
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:473:144"/> tooke a pawſe therein for the preſent time, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing the truce with <hi>Scotland,</hi> for three yeares and a halfe, and then the Ambaſſadours were all with much courteſie diſmiſſed, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the yeare 1525. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1525"/> From hence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for the terme of about ſeauenteene yeares the league was ſtill renued from time to time betweene the two Nations, though now and then the borderers on both ſides (thorow the inſtigation of the Earle <hi>Dowglaſſe,</hi> forſaken then of the Queene his wife, and baniſhed the realme againe) made ſome out-roades one into the others Marches. But all was quietly put vp, and the two kings continued good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours one to the other.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the yeare 1534. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1534"/> amongſt other proffers of marriage, propounded by <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour vnto king <hi>Iames</hi> (who was deſirous to match in his bloud) a motion was made of his couſine Germaine, the Ladye <hi>Mary</hi> king <hi>Henryes</hi> Daughter and Heire, who (as before you haue heard) had beene in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but now for the ſpace well neere of ten yeares had lien dead, and no further dealt in. King <hi>Iames</hi> anſwered in ſuch ſort, as there-by it ſeemed that hee had a good will to hearken vnto it.</p>
            <p>This Lady (that was afterward Queene of <hi>England</hi>) was once in ſpeach (as is before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) to haue beene marryed to the Emperour
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:473:144"/> himſelfe: after that to <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> king. But theſe motions were rather made (I take it) in policie, then proceeding of any ſuch mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in eyther of thoſe Princes, neyther hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilye had the King her Father any ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, thinking her a fitter matche for his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of <hi>Scotland,</hi> then for eyther of them. For in the latter end of this yeare, the King ſent thither the Biſhop of Saint <hi>Dauies,</hi> and the Lord <hi>William Howard,</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Norffolke,</hi> to intreate king <hi>Iames</hi> to appoint ſome time, when the King their Maiſter and hee might meete together, to conferre of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great importance, tending much to the benefit of both the Realmes. Further to tell him, that it might come to paſſe (if all things elſe ſorted to his liking) hee ſhould eſpouſe the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> his eldeſt Daughter (for his other Daughter the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> after her ſiſter Queene of <hi>England</hi> alſo was borne aboue a yeare before,) and with-all to make him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Monarch ouer the whole Iſland, if hee dyed with-out iſſue male.</p>
            <p>And to the end hee ſhould giue the more truſt and credit to theſe his promiſes, hee ſaid more-ouer, that hee would forth-with inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle him Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and his Vicar Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ouer the whole realme of <hi>England.</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> (as he had great reaſon ſo to do) intertained theſe offers with great thankfulneſſe, appointing
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:473:145"/> a time, when he would meete the King his Vncle, and ſo with many courtiſies diſmiſſed the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors. All this notwithſtanding, he was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly laboured by his Prelates, that they drew him quite from that reſolution, vpon this occaſion. A little before this Ambaſſage, King <hi>Henry</hi> had ſent the foreſaid Biſhop into <hi>Scotland</hi> with certaine <hi>Engliſh</hi> pamphlets, concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of religion: which being preſented vnto his nephew, with requeſt that he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly read them ouer, hee gaue them preſently to ſome about him to keepe, that were eſpeciall fauorers of the Clergie, and the religion of thoſe times, who had ſcantly turned ouer the firſt leafe, but with open mouth they condemned thoſe bookes, for moſt impious &amp; hereticall libels, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the king, they were glad from their hearts, that he had not ſtained his eies with the very view of ſuch peſtiferous and damnable doctrine. And for an infallible proofe of this their cenſure vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe bookes, it fell out about the ſame time, that the Pope had ſent a meſſenger into <hi>Scotland,</hi> requiring king <hi>Iames</hi> to ioyne with him againſt the king of <hi>England,</hi> whom hee had already ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged an Heretike, a Sciſmaticke, and a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock-breaker, for hee and Queene <hi>Katherine,</hi> ſome-times his Brothers wife, for the vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe thereof, were then lawfully parted. And further this <hi>Nuncio</hi> declared, that for theſe heynous offences, the Pope had depriued
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:473:145"/> him of his kingdome, which he beſtowed (for in ſuch caſes hee hath beene alwaies very liberall) vnto <hi>Iames</hi> and other popiſh Princes his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſonnes. Thus by the ſubtile practiſe of the Prieſts, who to vphold their reputation in the world, ſtill buzzed in their kings eares, that his Vncle ſought nothing more by this his deſired conference with him, but to withdraw him from the profeſſion of that ancient and Catholique religion, wherein their Fathers and fore-elders had liued ſo many hundred yeares together, in great happineſſe and felicitie, and withall being of him-ſelfe religiouſly giuen, according to the knowledge of thoſe ignorant times, hee was the more eaſilie diſſwaded from this promiſed mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Though King <hi>Henry</hi> had cauſe to take this part vnkindly at the others hands, neuer-the-leſſe hee was contented to put it vp, imputing the fault to them eſpecially, that eyther of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or vpon reſpect of their perticuler good, neglected the benefit that might haue followed heereof vnto the weale publique of the whole Iland.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> to ſhew how little hee was moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with this manner of dealing, beſtowed on his Nephew the yeare following the Garter, and according to the ceremonies thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, he was inſtalled at <hi>Windſor</hi> by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator the Lord <hi>Erskin.</hi> Within the compaſſe of the other ſeauen yeares remaining of my
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:473:146"/> former account, king <hi>Iames</hi> had marryed two wiues out of <hi>France.</hi> The former was the Lady <hi>Magdaline,</hi> eldeſt Daughter to king <hi>Francis,</hi> with whom hauing beene maried halfe a yeare, ſhee deceaſed, within little more then a moneth after her arriuall in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The ſecond, was Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and widdow to the Duke of <hi>Longeuille</hi> lately deceaſed. Within a yeare after this latter mariage, Queene <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> (his mother) departed this life, hauing firſt ſeene a young Prince (her grand-child) borne into the world, but neither hee, nor a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſonne, liued to ſucceed their father in the kingdome. King <hi>Henry</hi> knowing how much his Nephew was continually wrought, to breake off friendſhip with him, or at the leaſt to vſe the ſame for his owne aduantage onely, was much affraide that happily hee might at length bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and therefore was very deſirous to haue conference with him, and to eſtabliſh the league that hitherto had continued betweene them. To this end he once againe ſent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to entreate him to meete him at <hi>Yorke,</hi> where hee would communicate ſuch matter with him, as tended greatly to the good of both realmes. This meſſage thus deliuered by the Lord <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Howard,</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> and diuerſe of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, ſeemed willing enough to yeeld their conſents to this iourney. But contrariwiſe the Prelates mightily oppoſed them-ſelues againſt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:473:146"/> it. Amongſt other things, they alleadged that King <hi>Henry</hi> went about (which touched their free hold) to perſwade their King to take that courſe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which hee had done at home in his owne kingdome: namely, to expell the Pope, to vſurpe his authoritie ouer the Church, to diſſolue religious houſes, and to ſeize vpon their lands and reuenues. But rather then hee ſhould bee drawne to vſe any ſuch vnlawfull meanes, where-with to ſupplye his preſent wants, they freely offered to giue him yearely, out of their owne reuenues, thirtie thouſand Crownes: and if that would not ſerue his turne, they would vnder-take to aduantage him an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand more yearely, out of the lands and poſſeſſions of them, that were already falne from their due obedience to the ſea of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe faire promiſes preuailed ſo much with King <hi>Iames,</hi> that this meeting was alſo auoyded. But with-all an Ambaſſadour was immediatly ſent into <hi>England,</hi> as well to excuſe the King, as to require that Commiſſioners might bee appointed of either partie, to meete for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of ſome controuerſies then depending betweene the two Nations, which was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and performed accordingly on King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> part. Neuer-the-leſſe, when after ſundry iniuries ſtill offered by the <hi>Scottes,</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi> had once or twice yeelded to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conditions, and yet not-with-ſtanding,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:473:147"/> perceiued how little from time to time they were regarded: at the length, being not able to indure ſo many indignities, he reſolued to end all controuerſies by open warre. But firſt, to the end it might appeare to the world, how vnwillingly he was prouoked vnto it: before hee would take armes againſt his neere kinſman, hee cauſed a pamphlet to bee publiſhed in Print, declaring what mooued, or rather compelled him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto; wherein hee charged King <hi>Iames</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with deepe diſſimulation, his words taſting of Honey, but his deeds of Worme-wood. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſerious complaint whereof, he deſcendeth, or rather aſcendeth to a ſuppoſed title of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie, continued in a lineall ſucceſſion of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> ouer that nation from <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt (ſonne to <hi>Alured</hi> king of <hi>England</hi>) for aboue ſixe hundred yeares together, but hereof I haue ſpoken enough before. This done, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie was ſent to the Sea, to take all ſuch <hi>Scottiſh</hi> ſhips as fell into their walke, of which they brought into the Portes of <hi>England</hi> eight and twentie, fraught with many good commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scottiſh</hi> King here-vpon ſent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to demand reſtitution, ſeeing no warre was as yet proclaimed. But king <hi>Henry</hi> anſwered, that hee had no reaſon to yeeld there-vnto, till ſuch time, as recompence was made for the harme his ſubiects had ſuſtained on the borders.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:473:147"/> In the meane ſeaſon he had alſo prepared an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of ſome twenty thouſand men, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame to the conduct of the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,</hi> acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with the Earles of <hi>Shrewſbery, Darby, Cumberland, Surrey, Hertford, Angus, Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and diuerſe other Lords and Gentlemen of the North. King <hi>Iames</hi> hauing knowledge of this preparation entreated to haue all differences and complaints on both ſides put to order, and ſo taken vp.</p>
            <p>VVherevpon the King cauſed his army to ſtay about <hi>Yorke,</hi> appointing the Duke, the Lord priuy ſeale, and others, to enter into confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Ambaſſodours, and if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie they could to end all controuerſies, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to auoide the effuſion of much bloud. But when the Commiſſioners for <hi>England,</hi> perceiued that the <hi>Scottes</hi> ſought onely to detract time, whereby to put of the warre for that yeare (win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now approaching) they breake of the treaty, and hauing aſſembled the whole armie, there-with entred into <hi>Scotland</hi> the twentith day of October in the yeare 1542. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1542"/> During there abode there, diuerſe townes and villages were burned and ſpoiled, and hauing continued that courſe, as long as their victualls held out, the armie returned to <hi>Berwicke</hi> the nine and twentith daie of the ſame month, without reſiſtance or ſhow of enemie, although King <hi>Iames</hi> had then in readineſſe (as it is ſayd) an armie of thirtie
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:473:148"/> thouſand men, incamped at <hi>Fallamure,</hi> but foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene miles within <hi>Scotland.</hi> But whether it was, that they waited ſome aduantage, or that the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nobility were not ſo forward (which is pretended) as their King would haue had them, nothing was attempted againſt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> vntill the foure and twentith day of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember following, by which time the Duke was well on his way towards <hi>London.</hi> For then king <hi>Iames</hi> went him ſelfe vnto the VVeſt. marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he appointed the Lord <hi>Maxwell</hi> his warden, togither with the Earles of <hi>Caſſels</hi> and <hi>Glencorne,</hi> and certaine other Lords there with him to inuade <hi>England</hi> on that ſide. This army conſiſting of fifteene thouſand men paſſed ouer the water of <hi>Eſke,</hi> and burnt certaine hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the <hi>Greues</hi> on the verie border. Herevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Thomas</hi> baſtard <hi>Dacres,</hi> and <hi>Iacke</hi> of <hi>Muſgraue,</hi> with an hundred light horſes made towards the enemie, hauing a while before ſent to Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Wharton</hi> (Lord warden of thoſe Marches,) to make all the haſt hee could after them. By that time theſe two valiant Captaines had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the ſkirmiſh, the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> with ſome three hundred horſe more, were come within viewe of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> hoſt, who ſuppoſing that the Duke, or ſome other of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords was turned backe againe with the whole armie, (otherwiſe they imagined thoſe few would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue aduentured ſo deſperatly to ſet vpon
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:473:148"/> them) were with the ſuddeneſſe of this vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected flight put into ſuch a <hi>Panick</hi> feare, that forth-with committing themſelues to flight, as faſt as their legges could carrie them, or their horſes vnder them, they were purſued and taken, without any reſiſtance. Amongſt whom theſe following were the principal men. The Earles of <hi>Caſſels</hi> and <hi>Glencorne,</hi> the Lord <hi>Maxwel,</hi> the Lord <hi>Flemming,</hi> the Lo. <hi>Sommerwel,</hi> the Lord <hi>Oliphant,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> Sir <hi>Oliuer Sinclere</hi> the kings mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Iohn Roſſe</hi> of <hi>Gragie, Robert Aeſken</hi> Sonne to the Lord <hi>Aeſken,</hi> the Lord <hi>Maxwells</hi> two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and aboue two hundred men of name more. Of the common ſouliers not ſo few as eight hundred, ſo as ſome one <hi>Engliſhman</hi> had three or foure priſoners to his ſhare. The <hi>Scottes</hi> loſt at this blowe without anie bloud-ſhed on either partie, twentie peeces of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, foure Cart-loades of ſpeares, and tenne pauilions. Thus wee ſee, that the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and Earth can, and will daunt, the corrage of man, when it ſeemeth good vnto him, to the end we ſhould acknowledge him to be the only giuer of all victory. The <hi>Scottiſh</hi> writers attribute the bad ſucceſſe of their armie at this meeting, to the vnaduiſed courſe, which King <hi>Iames</hi> tooke in appointing a meane Gentleman (Sir <hi>Oliuer Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clere</hi>) his Lieutenant grnerall ouer the ſame.

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:473:149"/> ſitting at the Star-chamber, where the Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> rebuked them openly for their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour towards the King and Realme, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that his Maieſty had good cauſe to make warre vpon them.

And laſtly for inuading his dominions without open defiance, or iuſt cauſe giuen on his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties part. Neuertheleſſe that his Maieſtie more regarding his honour, then his Royall power, was contented to render good for euill, and curtiſie for vnkindneſſe. For whereas hee might by lawe of armes (as they knewe well enough) ſhut them vp in cloſe priſon, hee was contented that they ſhould bee committed to the cuſtodie of the Nobles of his land, that were thought meet to take that charge vpon them, according to their owne ſeuerall eſtates and degrees. Then beeing diſmiſſed thence, they were forth-with beſtowed with one Noble man or other accordingly, of whom they had ſuch curtious intertainment, as that they themſelues confeſſed, they neuer liued more pleaſantly at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time before. On the twentith of December newes was brought to the Court of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Kings death.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:473:150"/> be vnited, intimated their meaning to the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Lords, who ſeeming very willing therein to gratifie the King, were brought to the Court in Chriſt-maſſe holie daies, where they were lodged, feaſted, and entertained moſt louingly. There (as of themſelues) they motioned a mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age betweene Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the Kings Sonne now little more then fiue yeares olde, and their young Queene, that was borne ſome fiue or ſixe daies before the death of the King her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, promiſing withall to do there beſt to bring the ſame to paſſe. King <hi>Henrie</hi> gaue them great thankes for their forwardneſſe therein, and was not onelie contented to ſet them freelie at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but alſo beſtowed large preſentes on euery man according to his degree. On New-yeares daie they departed from <hi>London</hi> home-wardes, and dined at <hi>Enfield,</hi> where they ſawe the young Prince, of whome they ſeemed greatlie to reioyce both in ſpeach and countinance. From thence they kept on their iorney, till they came into the North-partes, where the Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> (the Kings Lieutenant) ſtaied for their comming, with whome they remained till ſuch pledges were come out of <hi>Scotland</hi> as was before couenanted they ſhould leaue behind them.

But that which more nearely touched them, was the eminent daunger, wherein to Religion would be thereby brought, the preſeruation whereof they were bound to prefer before either lands or liues, that the ſtate whereinto <hi>England</hi> was perſently falne, might be a ſufficient warning vnto them, who already were but ouer much inclined that way (for about that time the Gouener had incora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Frier <hi>Guillan,</hi> openly to preach againſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and fooliſh ceremonies, giuing liberty that who would might reade the bible in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> which about three yeares before was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read in very Church in <hi>England</hi> and was the very bane and breake necke of Popery, thorowe

As for their promiſſe made to King <hi>Henry,</hi> they were perſuaded, ther was no cauſe why they ſhould ſticke at that, ſeeing it was lately decreed in the Counſell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> that no couenant or promiſe how conſtantly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer made, ought to bee kept with an heretike, ſuch as the Pope had already iudged him to bee.

The Queene Mother, the regent, and the Cardinall, beeing all like affected, ſolicited King <hi>Francis</hi> to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter aide againſt <hi>England.</hi> But the monie that that was thereupon ſent them, and deliuered to the Earle of <hi>Lenox</hi> to bee imployed to that end, was by him detayned, by reaſon of ſome iarres then amongſt them-ſelues, which brought him

            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> in the meane ſeaſon, hauing not beene ſlow in his buſineſſe, thought good neuer-the-leſſe, to make triall whether vpon better aduiſements the <hi>Scottes</hi> would yeelde to ſome reaſonable conditions: wherefore he ſent his letters to <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> fraught with many iuſt complaints, and bitter threats, but all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed not: wher-vpon proceeding in his former courfe, and hauing furniſhed his Nauie with all things needfull, he committed the charge therof to the Earle of <hi>Hertford,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Dudley,</hi> Lord <hi>Liſle</hi> high Admirall of <hi>England,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> accompanied with the Lord <hi>Cobham, Clinton, Coniers, Sturton,</hi> the Lord <hi>William Howard,</hi> with many valiant Knights and Gentlemen.

At the firſt they made ſhowe to ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vantgard, but being aſſayled by fiue hundred harquebutters, and ſhroudly galled, after a light skirmiſh they made a ſodaine retraite but with ſuch ſpeed as they leaft their artillary behind them, The <hi>Scottes</hi> returned to <hi>Edenbrugh,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> kept their courſe to <hi>Lieth:</hi> entring the towne without any great reſiſtance, they lodged therein that night to their beſt aduantage. The next day they landed their victuals and great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillary. Hither the Lord Gouerner ſent <hi>Adam Otterburne</hi> prouoſt of <hi>Edenbrugh,</hi> with two of the baylifes, to know of the Earle of <hi>Hertford</hi> the cauſe of his coming offering that what wrong ſoeuer the <hi>Engleſhmen</hi> had receaued of them, ſhould be ſatiſfied to their full contentment and that vpon thoſe tearmes he would gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue him into the towne. The Earle anſwered that he had no commiſſion to treat of peace, but he was ſent thither to take reuenge on thoſe, that had falſified their faith vnto the King his maiſter, and therefore purpoſed to viſit there towne in ſuch manner, as happily they would nor like of, and ſoche bad him tel the Gouerner. Vpon the returne of this anſwere the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour taking order for the defence of the Caſtell, departed immediately to <hi>Sterling.</hi> The ſixt of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:473:153"/> May, the army marched towards <hi>Edenbrugh,</hi> at the approch whereof the <hi>Prouoſt</hi> (accompanied with one or two Burgeſſes and ſome officers of armes) deſired to ſpeake with the lieutenant: being brought to his preſence, he offered vnto him the keies of the towne on condition that the inhabitants might ſafely paſſe out with bag and bagage, &amp; the buildings preſerued from fire. Anſwere was made, that he was ſent thither to take reueng (as before) and therfore vnleſſe they would yeeld vp the towne ſimply without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; cauſe Men, Women &amp; Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to iſſue forth into the fields, &amp; ſubmit themſelues to his will &amp; pleaſure, he would proceed againſt them with all extremity. The <hi>Prouoſt</hi> replied, that they would rather ſtand to their defence, &amp; ſo depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> comming to the Cow-gate beat it open with their great ordinance, entred and ſlewe diuerſe that made reſiſtance: forth-with the great ordinance was drawn vp the high ſtreet within reach of the ſhot from the Caſtell, ſo as a culluering was diſmounted, and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> forced to retire, not with out ſome loſſe of men, night drawing on, they departed to there camp at <hi>Leith,</hi> for three dayes following they continewed firing the towne, and conſumed a great part there-of. In the meane ſeaſon foure thouſand light horſe-men were brought by land (as was appointed) from the Borders by the Lord <hi>Eeuers,</hi> who ioyning with the armie at
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:473:154"/> 
               <hi>Leith</hi> did ſuch exploits, that well neere they left neither pile, village, nor houſe vnburned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſeuen miles of <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> beſides the ſpoile, pillage, and droues of Cattell, that was euery daye brought to the Campe. Hauing thus wrought their wills there-about, they ſhipped their Artillarie and booties, carried away ſuch ſhips as they found in the Hauen, of which the principall were the <hi>Salamander</hi> (giuen by the <hi>French</hi> King at the mariage of his Daughter) and the other (called the <hi>Vnicorne</hi>) made by the laſt king. Theſe two were ballanced with Cannon ſhot, which was found in the towne, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of foure-ſcore thouſand peeces: the reſt, as well <hi>Scottiſh</hi> as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the more part were loden with the ſpoile and booties belonging to the common ſouldiers and mariners. On the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of this month, both the army by land, and the fleet, departed from <hi>Lieth</hi> in one houre, leauing the towne on fire, which was burned to the ground. The armie returning home-wards encamped that night at <hi>Seaton,</hi> ſeauen miles from <hi>Lieth,</hi> where they burned the Caſtell, and (for more diſpight) deſtroyed the gardens and Orchards, becauſe the Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> (owner of the ſame) had beene the Cardinals beſt friend, when hee was in priſon. The next night they incamped beſides <hi>Dunbar,</hi> where they had an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme giuen them. In the morning they burned the towne, and marching forwards, they were
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:473:154"/> ſomewhat ſtaied in the way by reaſon of a groſe foggie miſt; and a report that the Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> and the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> had aſſembled a powre, where-with to empeach their paſſage at a ſtrait called the <hi>Peaſe.</hi> But when the day cleared about two of the clocke in the after-noone, the armie ſetting forward, paſſed the ſtraite without ſhew of enemie, that would not abide their comming. That night the armie lodged at <hi>Rantton</hi> 8. miles from the borders, from whence the next day (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 28. of May) they came to <hi>Berwick,</hi> hauing loſt in all this iorney not aboue forty perſons, for which happy ſucceſſe they rendred thanks to almighty God the giuer of all victorie.

               <hi>Mathew</hi> Earle of <hi>Lennox,</hi> being now wrought out of fauour with the <hi>French</hi> king, by the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Queene Mother and the Cardinall, thought <hi>Scotland</hi> no ſafe place for him, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make himſelfe the more able to reſiſt the malice of his enimies at home, he made meanes to be entertained of the King of <hi>England.</hi> Taking therfore the ſea, with ſome other Noblemen of his country, he arriued at <hi>Weſtcheſter</hi> about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer folowing. From thence (hauing firſt made his way to the King) he repaired to the Court, where being well entertained, he maried ſhortly after the Lady <hi>Margaret Dowglas,</hi> daughter and heire to the Earle of <hi>Angus</hi> by Queene <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> king <hi>Henries</hi> ſiſter, who thervpon

From this coople deſcended two ſonnes. <hi>Henry Steward</hi> Lord <hi>Dernley</hi> (the eldeſt) was Father to <hi>Iames</hi> the ſixt that now reigneth. <hi>Mathew</hi> the other Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther married <hi>Elizabeth Candiſh,</hi> Daughter to the Counteſſe of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> (the moſt famous buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (of a woman) in the world; by whom he had onely iſſue the Lady <hi>Arbella,</hi> (a beautifull plant) trayned vp (as I heare) by the Counteſſe her grand-mother, in all commendable qualities, and exerciſes of vertue and piety. King <hi>Iames,</hi> in regard of his iuſt title and claime to theſe lands, receiueth of the Queenes maieſty that now is an yearely penſion. The Earle of <hi>Lennox</hi> being deſirous to ſhow his good will to do the King ſome acceptable ſeruice, obtayning cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bands of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> entred into <hi>Scotland</hi> but he found not that conſtancy in his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that he expected, and therefore was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to returne without atchieuing his principal purpoſe; though his labour was not all-togither loſt, for he raiſed and tooke diuerſe Caſtells, as that in the Ile of <hi>Arraine</hi> belonging to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor, &amp; the Caſtell of <hi>Roſſey</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Bute,</hi> from whence the royall family of the <hi>Stewards</hi> (Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> now for the ſpace of two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty yeares) tooke their beginning.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:473:156"/> Though King <hi>Henry</hi> at this time alſo maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſharpe war with <hi>France,</hi> neuertheleſſe hee ceaſed not to take the oportunity offred him, thorow the ciuill diſſention amongſt the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nobility, making continual roads &amp; forreis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Countries. About the midſt of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry following, Sir <hi>Ralph Eeuers,</hi> Lord warden of the middle Marches entred <hi>Scotland</hi> with foure thouſand <hi>Engliſh, Iriſh,</hi> &amp; aſſured <hi>Scots,</hi> paſſing to <hi>Iedworth</hi> without any reſiſtance. He vnderſtood there, that the gouerner with the Earle of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> were lately come to the Abbay <hi>Melroſſe,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 8. miles diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, purpoſing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the repaire of their forces, haſtning the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward. Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> therefore (about mid night) marching from thence, hoped vpon the ſudden to take them at ſome great aduantage, beeing as yet ouer fewe to make reſiſtance. But the <hi>Scottes</hi> hauing knowledge by their Eſpialls, of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, (though ſome-what to late) forſooke their lodgings, before they had good wills to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, &amp; leauing bag &amp; baggage behind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in all haſt they withdrew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the next moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to obſerue the behauior of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who finding the place abandoned, tooke the ſpoile of al they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the towne &amp; Abbay, vtterly defacing the Monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of th' <hi>Douglaſſes,</hi> greatly to the diſpleaſure of the Earle of <hi>Angus</hi> &amp; his linage, and ſo returned back towards <hi>Ied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth:</hi> by this time the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the <hi>Scots</hi> was wel
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:473:157"/> increaſed, by the repaire of <hi>Norman Liſle,</hi> Sonne to the Earle of <hi>Rothſey</hi> (a young Gentleman of good expectation) and of <hi>Walter Scot</hi> with ſuch troopes as accompanied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thither, in ſo much as the Gouerner was encoraged to giue the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> battaile before they ſhould reach <hi>Iedworth,</hi> but becauſe they truſted not altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their ſtrength, it was deuiſed, that the maine battaile of the <hi>Scottes</hi> ſhould lie cloſely in a vallie, to receiue the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> at vnawares, which tooke effect accordingly. For the <hi>Scottes</hi> ſending all their horſes with their keepers, and thoſe that might beſt be ſpared, to the top of the hil, vnder which they were embattailed, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen</hi> were trained within their danger, which beeing perceiued by theſe <hi>Scots</hi> that came on their ſide, (who were ſome 7. or 8. hundred) they preſently fel of and ioyned with the enemy. The <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> neuertheleſſe ſtuck to it, till a great number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were ſlaine, the reſt beeing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weried with that daies and the laſt nights tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, betooke themſelues to flight. The middle battaile ſeeing their fellowes thus diſcomfeited, they alſo turned and brake into the reereward in ſuch confuſed manner, as thereby the whole army was put out of order, no man knowing whom to follow for his Captaine. The <hi>Scottes</hi> in the meane time taking the aduantage of the winde and the Sunne, were vpon them before they could well diſcerne what they were. In
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:473:157"/> this confuſion, euery man ſought to ſaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whereof inſued a great ſlaughter with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall loſſe on the other ſide. Beſids Sir <hi>Rafe Euers,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Ogle</hi> and Sir <hi>Brian Layton,</hi> who were chiefe Commanders, diuers other gentlemen were ſlaine, in the whole number of two hundred, a thouſand were taken priſoners well nere, of whom ſome foure ſcore were men of qualitie and ſpeciall note. Though the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this victory fell to the Gouernor, the glory thereof redownded to the <hi>Dowglaſſes.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> was much greeued for the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Sir <hi>Rafe Euers,</hi> whoſe ſeruice had bene ſuch in theſe late warrs with the <hi>Scottes,</hi> that he had brought the more part of all thoſe, that inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within twenty miles of the borders of <hi>Eng.</hi> vnto the obedience of King <hi>Henry,</hi> who now were the chiefe cauſe of his deſtruction in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as you haue heard. This yeare the <hi>French</hi> King ſent <hi>Mongomery</hi> into <hi>Scotland</hi> with foure thouſand <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> of whome fiue hundred were lances, theſe ioyning with the <hi>Scottes,</hi> to the number of fifteene thouſand in the whole, came to the borders, encamping ouer againſt <hi>Warke</hi> Caſtle, from whence paſſing ouer the riuer euery other day, they entred into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and returned backe againe at night, with ſuch booties as they got: In this manner hauing praied vpon the inhabetants fiue or ſixe miles compaſſe, for the ſpace of a weeke to gether,

The taking of <hi>Robert Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> (a gallant young Gentleman, eldeſt ſonne to the Lord <hi>Maxwell</hi>) was of greateſt note.

Thus it pleaſed the Lord in his wiſdome, to giue honour to our family by ſuch a meane, as the world then held reprochfull, and contrariwiſe to impaire the ſtate and reputation of the ſame, by ſuch a match, as in the iudgment of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for ſhe was honorably deſcended) ſhould rather haue giuen more eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation vnto it.

The Earle of <hi>Hertford,</hi> with a new armie of ſome twelue thouſand horſmen &amp; footmen, entring <hi>Scotland,</hi> burned a great part of the <hi>Mers</hi> &amp; <hi>Tiuidale,</hi> amongſt the reſt, the towne and Abbay of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> and <hi>Melroſſe</hi> Abbay, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was a while defended by 300. <hi>Scots,</hi> but in the end the moſt of them were either ſlaine or taken priſoners. The army hauing in this maner paſſed along the further ſide of <hi>Tweed</hi> (but not far within the country) returned home without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. In Ianuary following, this renowned Prince, not inferiour to any other liuing in thoſe dayes (&amp; yet that age brought forth more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, then for many yeares before Chriſtendome had inioyed together) departed out of this life, who had ſo great deſire to haue vnited theſe two nigh kingdoms, as that (it is ſaid) he gaue eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all charge to the lords of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell at his death, to indeuor the effecting of the promiſed mariage

To which end the lord Protector, being wel prouided both by land &amp; ſea, paſſed into <hi>Scotland</hi> the next yeare about the beginning of September, cauſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be made in 3. ſeueral quarters of his campe, ſignifying, that the cauſe of his comming was to make knowne to all that nation, that his intent was onely to renue the treaty of the long intended mariage, betweene the King of <hi>England</hi> and their Princeſſe, offering all maner of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies to as many amongſt them, as would ſhew themſelues fauorers therof. The armie marching along by the ſea coaſt, was ſtill attended by the fleet, ſo as vpon euery occaſion the one might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the others want. Such Caſtles &amp; houlds as were in their walke; ſome were rendred, others taken by force and ruinated. As the armie paſſed, the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> light-horſemen prouoked the <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to skirmiſh, but commandement was giuen,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:473:160"/> that none ſhould ſtir againſt them. The 9. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the Nauie lodged at <hi>Preſton</hi> within view of the <hi>Scottes,</hi> who were incamped at the mouth of the riuer of <hi>Eske,</hi> within little more then a mile one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other. The <hi>Scotiſh</hi> prickers were now more buſie then before, ſhewing themſelues on the top of an hill in their greateſt brauery. The <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> could not indure to be ſo bearded, &amp; therfore the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wilton</hi> (Captaine ouer the horſemen) obtained leaue at length to ſet on them with a band of light horſemen, and certaine demilances to back them withall. Theſe hauing mounted the hill, the <hi>Scots</hi> at firſt made ſhew to giue the charge, but had no ſuch meaning: for ſome 500. of them comming forward vpon the ſpurs with a great ſhout (after their maner) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their ſtaues length of the formoſt troope, and then purpoſing to haue wheeled about &amp; be gon: the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> at an inſtant vnlooked for, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them ſo roughly, as that at the firſt incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter, and afterwards in the chaſe, within three houres ſpace, aboue 800. of the <hi>Scots</hi> were ſlaine within ſight of their own army. The Lord <hi>Hume</hi> by a fall from his horſe in the flight, receiued ſuch an hurt that he died thereof ſhortly after. His ſonne and heire, ſix Gentlemen, and two Prieſts were taken priſoners. On the <hi>Engliſh</hi> party, but one was hurt yet diuerſe were taken priſoners by aduenturing ouer-farre in purſuite of the enemy, amongſt whom were Sir <hi>Ralphe Bulmere, Thomas Gower</hi> Marſhall of <hi>Barwicke,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Crouch,</hi> all

The Protector knowing that the <hi>Scottes</hi> were not a little diſcouraged by this ouer-throw giuen the horſmen, &amp; perceiuing no diſpoſition in them to giue battaile, vnleſſe it were vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great aduantage, thought it now a fit time to make trial whether yet they would harken vnto his reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable demands, which he ſignified to the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in writing, to this effect, as <hi>Buchanan</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.

               </gap>e league and amity between the two nations, which by no meanes elſe could be effected, then by that mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which by their free conſents had bin already faithfully promiſed, &amp; by publike writing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally approued &amp; ratified, vpon ſuch conditions as were more fauorable on their ſide, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their owne, ſuch as brought them into no manner of bondage, but into a friendly ſociety of life and community, of either fortune, good or bad.

That they could not deny, but it was neceſſary their Queene ſhould marry, conſequently that their greateſt care would bee, how to beſtow her. That if they would make choiſe of a husband fitteſt for her, in regard both of his owne worth, &amp; the good that ſhould redound to their common-weale; whom could they preferre before the King their next neighbor, borne and bred vp in the ſame Iland, of her own bloud, trained vp after one maner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, vſing the ſame language, and not onely in powre and riches, but well nere in all things (ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding either to profit or pleaſure) farre before her, and which ſhall bring with it, a neuer fading ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and an vtter burning in obliuion the memory of all former malice and diſſention? where-as if the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhall entertaine a ſtranger, differing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them in lawes, language, and maner of life, what a number of inconueniences will follow thereof? The miſchiefe that by ſuch occaſion hath falne vpon other nations, may be a ſufficient warning: &amp; better it were to be wiſe by other mens harms, then by experience to buy witt at ſo deare a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning. That for his part, if he found them incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the mariage, he would remit ſome part of the former agreement, and bee contented that their Queene ſhould bee brought vp amongſt them at home, till ſhee were of age to make her choice, that in the meane ſeaſon, peace ſhould be
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:473:162" rendition="simple:additions"/> kept betweene the two nations, but with this condition, that their Queene ſhould not in the meane time bee tranſported out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that no compact of marriage ſhould bee made either with the <hi>French</hi> king, or any other forraine Prince. If they would faithfully promiſe thus much, he would then in peaceable manner imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly depart with his armie, and what-ſo-euer damage they had ſuſtained ſince his comming into their realme, it ſhould bee ſatisfied by the iudgement of indifferent Arbitrators, choſen on both ſides. The Gouerner hauing receiued this letter, imparted the ſame to very few about him, fearing that if it had paſſed many mens hands, the greater number would haue inclined to the offred conditions of peace, being ſo reaſonable, which made him the rather conceaue, that vnleſſe the Duke had diſtruſted his ſtrength, hee would not haue made ſo faire wether with him.

Thus both contending who ſhould firſt poſſeſſe this hill, together with the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the winde &amp; Sunne, the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were forced, by the forwardnes of the enimy, to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon a very deſperate peece of ſeruice. The <hi>Scottiſh</hi> armie was marſhalled in this maner. The Earle of <hi>Angus</hi> lead the vant-gard, conſiſting of 8000. footmen, garded with fiue peeces of great Ordinance on the right hand, &amp; about 400. horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the left. The Gouernor was placed behind him, with ten thouſand <hi>Inland-men</hi> (as they call them) accounted the choiſeſt ſoldiers, the whole country affordeth. The Earle of <hi>Huntley</hi> had the leading of the rere-ward of 8000. men, well nigh euen with the maine battaile on the left ſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both flanked with 4000.

Their armor (for the moſt part) was a good skul or Iack, ſhort ſword very broad and ſharpe, dagger &amp; buckler, and a kerchiefe wreathed and wrapped twice or thrice about their collers. In this aray they ſtood cloſly together, holding their pikes in both ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and with-all their bucklers on the left, the point breſt high, and the other end reſting againſt the right foot, the fore-ranck bending their knees to giue their fellows behind leaue to couer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with their pikes, &amp; croſſing one another in ſuch forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maner, as (if they ſtood faſt) neither man

On the other ſide, the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> Lord Lieutenant of the armie, conducted the fore-ward of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand footmen. The Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> the rere-ward of like number and qualitie. The middle-ward of foure thouſand footmen, was conducted by the Generall him-ſelfe.

There was betweene the two armies a deepe ditch which the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were to paſſe, before they could come to the enimie, many that could not leape ouer, ſtuck faſt therein, with no ſmall danger to them-ſelues, and impediment to their fellowes that followed.

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe the <hi>Scottes</hi> kept their order and ſtand ſo firmely, that at this ſharpe incounter, ſixe and twenty Gentlemen, beſides nere two hundred others, were ſlaine out right, amongſt whome <hi>Edward Shelley,</hi> Lieutenant vnto the Lord <hi>Graie</hi> (of his band of <hi>Bulleners</hi>) as he was the firſt that paſſed the ditch, ſo in likelihood the firſt alſo that loſt his life. Few of them, that were placed in the formoſt rancks, returned without hurt on himſelfe or his horſe. The Lord <hi>Gray</hi> was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly wounded in the mouth with a pike.

In the meane ſeaſon the <hi>Scottes</hi> aduanced their bands with good corrage, though by ſhot both from land and ſea, they were ſhrowdly galled.

The ſlaughter was ſo great, that the riuer of <hi>Eſke</hi> was ſtained with bloud, which lay Eaſt-ward from the place of battaile, and runneth North-ward into the <hi>Firth.</hi> Not ſo few as ten thouſand <hi>Scottes</hi> loſt their liues, all within the ſpace of fiue houres, from one of the clocke till ſixe. Of this number, (beſides the Lord <hi>Flemming</hi>) about two thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d were men of good quality. Aboue fifteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred were taken priſoners, amongſt whome the Earle of <hi>Huntley,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Yeſter, Hobby Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> (Captaine of <hi>Dumbar</hi>) the Maiſter of <hi>Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poll,</hi> the Lord <hi>Weames,</hi> and a brother of the Earle of <hi>Caſſels,</hi> were of beſt account. For to one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman their were twenty of the common ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours taken priſoners, by reaſon they were all ſo meanly apparelled, as that the better ſort, could not bee knowne from the reſt; who otherwiſe might haue eſcaped with their liues. This victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fell to the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> neere <hi>Muſſel-brugh,</hi> on Saterday being the tenth day of September in the yeare of our Lord God 1547. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1547"/> Two of my Fathers men, hauing loſt him in the chaſe, in their returne found one ſlaine, ſo verie like him in all reſpectes, and more eſpeciallie by a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle about the finger, whereon he vſed to weare a great ringe, as that with much ſorrowe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation they buried him. Hee was one of them, that gaue the firſt on-ſet on the enemies pikes, whereat his horſe receiued his deathes
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:473:165"/> wound, but ſerued notwithſtanding all that day after.</p>
            <p>After this the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> by ſea entred the Ile of <hi>Colme,</hi> a place by ſcituation very ſtronge, ſtanding in the <hi>Firthe,</hi> about foure miles from <hi>Lieth,</hi> wherein was an Abbie, but the Monkes had abandoned the ſame. Here and at the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of <hi>Browghtie-Cragge</hi> (which ſtood in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into the <hi>Taie</hi>) gariſons of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were placed, for the more anoyance of thoſe that were to paſſe vp thoſe riuers. In the returne of the armie by land, <hi>Hume</hi> Caſtell and <hi>Faſt</hi> Caſtell (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome reſiſtance) were ſurrendred and fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> At their comming to <hi>Box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brugh</hi> they alſo erected a fortification vpon the ruines of an olde Caſtell, and placed a gariſon therein. Here the Lord Protector receiued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Leardes and Gentlemen, of the beſt account thorow the whole Countries of <hi>Mers</hi> and <hi>Tiuidale,</hi> vnto the obedience of the King of <hi>England,</hi> wherevnto they bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by ſeuerall oth. The lord Gouerner of <hi>Scotland</hi> and the Queene Mother, made ſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance alſo by meſſage, to be willing to haue come to a treaty with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lords, but whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their meaning was, all their faire ſhowes turned to nothing. And truely in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man it was much to be admired, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the great good that was hoped might haue followed thereof to both Nations) what
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:473:165"/> ſhould mooue the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nobility to bee ſo much bent againſt this marriage, eſpecially now that the Cardinall was dead, who ouer-ruled the reſt while he liued. But he, that ſeeth the ſtate of all things and time at one inſtant, knoweth what is fitteſt to bee admitted in euery ſeaſon, and diſpoſeth of the ſucceſſe, of all that man purpoſeth, to the beſt aduantage of ſuch as ſerue him. For if this marriage, ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and inforced, had then taken place, who knoweth into what eſtate, both this and that Realme alſo, ſhould haue beene therby brought, after the death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> (the young Queene hauing togither with her title ſo many great friends both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and happily here alſo in <hi>England</hi> that would haue taken her part in that quarrell)? While the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> was thus occupied on the Eaſt part of <hi>Scotland</hi> the Earle of <hi>Lennox</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> (warden of the VVeſt Marches) at his appointment entred into <hi>Scotland</hi> one that ſide alſo.</p>
            <p>This army conſiſted of ſome eight hundred horſe, and fiue thouſand foot-men. Firſt, the Caſtell of <hi>Milke</hi> (a fortreſſe of good ſtrength) was ſurrendred, paſſing from thence further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country, they ouerthrew the Church &amp; ſteeple at <hi>Annand,</hi> fortified by the <hi>Scottes,</hi> and then ſet the towne on fire.

But becauſe ſome of you, who oppoſe your ſelues here-vnto, cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Gods prouidence herein, for the vniting of both realmes, yet may neuer-the-leſſe here-after obiect as before you haue done, our fault here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is, that we ſeeke not equality, nor the mariage, but a conqueſt, that wee would not bee friends and fellowes, but Lordes ouer you: Although our proclamation, and priuate letters at the laſt warres, doe ſufficiently declare the contrary, yet here we proteſt to you and all Chriſtian people, that it is the Kings minde by our aduiſe and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:473:174"/> counſell, not to winne and ſubdue by force, but to conciliate by milde courſe: not to ſpoile and kill, but to ſaue &amp; keepe: not to diſſeuer and diuorce, but to ioyne in mariage both Prince and people, to make of one Iland, one kingdome vnited in loue, amitie, concord, peace and Chriſtian chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. If you refuſe and reiect this kindneſſe, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by compell vs to vſe armes, who ſhall bee giltie of the bloud-ſhed? who cauſeth battailes, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of houſes, and other extremities and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes that acompany warre? can it bee denied, but that we haue the great ſeale of <hi>Scotland,</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by generall conſent in your Parliament, for a teſtimonie againſt you.

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:473:182"/> had beene foreſeene in time, the enemie had been in great danger of an vtter ouer-throw. The <hi>Almaignes,</hi> that at this ſeruice tooke part with the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> hauing in the meane time committed the cuſtodie of their baggage to their women &amp; boies, were disburthened by the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> prickers, of ſo much as was worth the cariage. But <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Romero</hi> with his band of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſped much worſe. For the enemies ſodenly ſetting vpon them, where they lay incamped neere the towne of <hi>Coldingham,</hi> ſlew both their Captaine, and well-neere the whole number of them. About this time, <hi>Fast</hi> Caſtell was recouered by ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem out of the <hi>Engliſhmens</hi> hands.

<pb facs="tcp:473:183"/> created Duke of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> By reaſon of which vnhappy iarres, it was thought neceſſary to giue ouer the keeping of <hi>Hadington,</hi> being a matter in deed of more charge then profit, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it could not bee victualed, but by the conuoy of an armie. The Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> was therefore ſent thither againe, to ſee the fortification raſed, and to conduct the men and munition ſafely into <hi>England,</hi> which was performed accordinglye. <hi>Monſieur Thermes</hi> and his aſſociates being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with not a little incouraged, in <hi>February</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſiedged <hi>Browghtie-Cragge,</hi> which together with an other fortification neere vnto it, were in ſhort time recouered out of the <hi>Engliſhmens</hi> hands, wanting meanes to make reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo ſtrong an enimie: neuer-the-leſſe they would not yeeld, ſo long as any man well-neere was able to ſtand in the defende of the charge they had vnder-taken.

Amongſt other articles compriſed in this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one was, that all ſuch Caſtels, Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſtrengths, held by the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> in any part of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> dominions, ſhould be reſtored to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that the Forts of <hi>Dowglaſſe, Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi> &amp; <hi>Aymoth,</hi> which the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> had erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the time of theſe warres, ſhould forth-with be razed and throwne downe, to auoide all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of new controuerſie. <hi>Mounſier de Mourret</hi> was ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi> from the <hi>French</hi> King, to publiſh this accord betweene the three Nations, <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Aprill in the yeare (that followed) 1550. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1550"/> was in euery point executed accordingly.

Neither were the broiles betweene them in thoſe two laſt yeares of her raigne, of any great reckoning, which grew by occaſion of the warre made by King <hi>Philip</hi> her husband of the <hi>French</hi> King: for he therevpon ſolicited the Queene Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of <hi>Scotland</hi> (who about two yeares before obtained that dignity) while the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners of both theſe nations were buſie at <hi>Carliel,</hi> about the renuing of the league, to inuade this realme. She being willing to gratifie her confederate, when the Commiſſioners had broken vp the treatie of Peace without any concluſion, aſſembled a great Armie, where-with comming to <hi>Kellſoe</hi> in the moneth of October 1557. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1557"/> ſhee together with <hi>Monſieur Doiſell</hi> and other <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> began to perſwade the <hi>Scottes</hi> to inuade the realme. The <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nobility, to the end they would ſeeme ſome-what to yeeld to her requeſt, paſſing with the army ouer the riuer of <hi>Tweed,</hi> beſieged <hi>Warke</hi> Caſtell, whereat lying for the ſpace of 2. or 3. daies, and then hearing of the approach of the Earle of <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> (Lieutenant of the <hi>North</hi>) after ſome conſultation vpon this point, the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> lords concluded, that for ſo much as the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen</hi> had giuen them no iuſt cauſe of quarrell, eſpecially in ſo high a degree and meaſure of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:473:184"/> that the Queene Regent had drawne them thither, for the pleaſure onely of the <hi>French</hi> King and the reputation of <hi>Monſieur Doiſell</hi> his agent, who in the managing of this affaire had carryed himſelfe very loftily: therefore (I ſay) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to breake vp the ſiedge, and to returne homewards, and ſo this much adoe produced no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The Queene and her <hi>Monſieur</hi> tooke the matter very greeuouſlie, accounting themſelues much diſgraced here-with, but becauſe there was no remedy, for the preſent time they reſolued to beare it as paciently as they could, hoping a time would come, that ſhould make them of more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority amongſt them.

                  <p>VVe haue often heretofore earneſtly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you, both by worde and wryting, that it would pleaſe you to remoue the <hi>French</hi> forces, which now for the tearme of one yeare more haue many waies intollerablie oppreſſed the poore, and put the whole Nation in feare of a moſt miſerable bondage and thrawldome. But when we perceiued, that theſe our iuſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions did preuaile nothing with you, wee were then inforced (by way of complaint) to lay open our pitiful eſtate vnto our next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Prince, the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> and with teares to craue aide of her to repulſe by force of armes (if otherwiſe it cannot bee) thoſe ſtrangers, that ſeeke to bring vs vnder their ſubiection. But although ſhee (being mooued with compaſſion ouer our calamities) will vndertake the defence of our cauſe: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the end wee may performe our duties towardes the Mother of our Queene, and (as much as wee may) refraine from the effuſion of Chriſtian bloud, and then onely to arme our
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:473:188"/> ſelues, when otherwiſe wee cannot obtaine our right: wee held it our partes to beſeech you againe and againe, that forth-with you will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all the <hi>French</hi> forces to depart hence. For whoſe more ſpeedie paſſage, the Queene of <hi>England</hi> will not onelie graunt them ſafe conduct, to paſſe thorowe her kingdome, but will preſently take order they ſhalbe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by her nauie into <hi>France.</hi> If you make light reckning hereof, wee call God and man to witneſſe, that wee haue not armed our ſelues vpon malice or ſtomacke, but are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willinglie and of meere neceſſitie inforced to aduenture vpon extreame remidies, leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wee ſuffer the common-weale, our ſelues, and all our poſteritie to bee caſt downe headlong, into an irrecouerable deapth of infinite calamities.

            <p>Theſe laſt wordes, in the ſhutting vp of the letter, were ſpoken <hi>(I take it)</hi> of the preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of <hi>Scotland</hi> touching Religion. For nowe had the better part of the Nobility taken vpon them the defence of the Preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, wherevpon they were named the Lords of the Congregation. And this was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall occaſion of theſe broiles betwixt the Queene Regent (who would haue maintained poperie) and thoſe of the Nobility. How hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Chriſtian a part was it then of the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> to interpoſe her ſelfe into ſo iuſt a quarrell, as is the defence of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, apoſtolicall, and vndoubted Religion? and how much ſhall that Nation bee for euer bound vnto her Maieſtie, for ſo ineſtimable a benefit, as thereby it hath hitherto happily enioyed? What anſwere the Queene made to the Lords I find not, but ſtill one or other labored by all
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:473:189"/> poſſible meanes, to worke a reconciliation, but al was in vaine, for the Queene would not yeeld to the ſending away of the <hi>French</hi> forces, on which point the Lords ſtood ſtiflie. At the approach of the army to <hi>Lieth,</hi> on the ſixt daie of Aprill, the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> to the number of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred, iſſuing out of the towne, tooke poſſeſſion of a little <hi>Knole,</hi> (called the <hi>Halkes-hill</hi>) thereby to preuent the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> from incamping there, but at length the enemy (with the loſſe of ſome ſeauen ſcore men, was beaten backe to the very gates of the towne. Diuerſe <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were alſo ſlaine, and many more hurt, but if it had beene knowne, what aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage was offred by the <hi>French,</hi> their whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (it was thought) might therby haue beene vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ouerthrowne. VVhile the Lord <hi>Graie</hi> was at <hi>Muskelbrough,</hi> on his way thitherward, he ſent Sir <hi>Iames Croft</hi> and Sir <hi>George Howard</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Queene, to intreat an abſtinence of warre for foure and twenty houres, that in the meane time he might make knowne vnto her the cauſe of his comming in that manner: and further that vpon ſome conditions hee would accept of peace. The Queene (conſenting herevnto) ſent an Harauld to <hi>Lieth</hi> to giue knowledge thereof, but whether the fault was in the meſſinger, or in the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> armie was inforced to the fight: after which hee refuſed any more parliance. But proceeded to the ſiedge of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:473:190"/> 
               <hi>Lieth,</hi> which was no leſſe valiantly aſſailed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> then by the aduerſe partie it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. During which, an accident happned in the towne, that more indangered and damnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the enemie in one night, then the aſſiliantes had done before in twentie. For on the laſt day of Aprill, about two hours before Sun-ſet, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine fire aroſe in the towne, which beeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by an outragious winde then aloft, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the next morning, hauing conſumed a great part of the buildings, and amongſt the reſt certaine common Garners and Store-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherein was great prouiſion of corne and victualls. Neither were the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſlowe in purſuing the aduantage thereof. For by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing their great Ordinance on that ſide the towne, they beat backe thoſe, which labored to quench the fire, and entring the ditches, tooke the height of the wall, and ſo egarly aſſaulted the breaches, that had not the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> fore-ſeene the danger they were falne into, and continew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally applied their buſineſſe, and ſtood to it man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on euery quarter, that nightes worke (as it was thought) would haue ended the warre for that time. The ſiedge continued neere ſixe weekes longer, in which time many loſt their liues on both ſides. At one aſſault (which was the ſharpeſt of all the reſt) an eight ſcore <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> were ſlaine outright, and not ſo few may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and hurt. But ſtill, thorow the eſpeciall care
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:473:190"/> and good fore-ſight of the Duke of <hi>Northfolke</hi> (then appointed to remaine in the North-partes for the direction of this ſeruice) their wants whatſoeuer, were from time to time ſupplied. The <hi>French</hi> King, vnderſtanding into what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe the towne was brought (for the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were now worne &amp; ouerweried with continuall watching &amp; warding) ſent two Ambaſſadors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> County <hi>Randon</hi> and <hi>Monluc</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> to treat with the Queene for a peace with <hi>Scotland,</hi> his wiues kingdome. For hee held it an indgnity to ſeeke it at his ſubiects handes the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lords. Her Maieſty being not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to accept of any reaſonable conditions, ſo as the <hi>French</hi> might be remoued, was content to aſſociate vnto them Maiſter Secretary <hi>Cecill</hi> (afterwards Lord <hi>Burley</hi> and high Treaſurer of <hi>England</hi> whileſt he liued, mine honorable good Lord and Maiſter) and Doctor <hi>Wutton</hi> deane of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Yorke.</hi> Theſe paſſing togither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland</hi> after ſome three weeke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> trauell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a peace on the eight day of Iuly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was immediatly proclaimed at <hi>Lieth</hi> in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The moſt mighty Princeſſe <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by the grace of God Queene of <hi>England, France</hi> &amp; <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> defender of the faith &amp;c. And the moſt Chriſtian King <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Marie</hi> by the ſame grace of God, King and Queene of <hi>France</hi> and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:473:191"/> 
                  <hi>Scotland,</hi> haue accorded vpon a reconciliation peace and amity, to be inuiolably kept betweene them, their ſubiectes, kingdomes, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. And therefore in their names, it is ſtreitly commanded to all manner of perſones borne vnder their obedience, or being in their ſeruice, to forbeare all hoſtility, either by ſea or land, and to keepe good peace each with other, from this time forwards, as they wil anſwere there-vnto at their vttermoſt perills.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt materiall articles were theſe: that all the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> ſhould depart the Realme, with bagge and bagage, within the tearme of twentie daies next following. And becauſe they wanted (at that preſent) ſhippes enough to receiue ſo great a number, the Queene of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould furniſh them there-with, leauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them pleadges for their ſafe returne. That <hi>Lieth</hi> ſhould bee deliuered vp to the <hi>Scottes,</hi> the walles and fortifications about it raiſed and throwne downe. That the fortification erected by the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> before the Caſtell of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> ſhould be alſo caſt downe. Thus much beeing performed on the <hi>French</hi> partie, the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſhould forth-with breake vp the ſiedge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. That <hi>Mary Queene</hi> of <hi>Scottes,</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of her husband, ſhould by an act made to that end, bury in obliuion all attempts and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions done or interpriſed by the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lordes
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:473:191"/> againſt their authoritie, from the tenth day of Marche, in the yeare 1558, to the firſt of Auguſt this preſent yeare 1560. which acte ſhould bee ratified in Parliament then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atlie to bee holden by the eſtates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the approbation and allowance of the ſaid King and Queene of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> That three-ſcore <hi>French-men</hi> ſhould ſtill abide in the Ile of <hi>Iuskeith,</hi> and as many in the Caſtell of <hi>Dunbarre,</hi> leaſt otherwiſe the Queene might ſeeme to bee diſpoſſeſſed of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Laſtlie that the King and Queene of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhould not from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth vſurpe the title, or beare the Armes of <hi>England,</hi> ſithence the ſame onely belonged of right to the Queene of <hi>England.</hi> Whileſt theſe Ambaſſadours were paſſing into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Queene Regent deceaſed at <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> which happily gaue readier diſpatch to this buſineſſe. Thus was that Nation disburthened of this ſeruitude to the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> amongſt whome <hi>Monſieur la Broſſe</hi> (one of the chiefe Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders vnder the Queene Regent) aduiſed his maiſter the French King (as by intercepting of his Letters was diſcouered) to haue brought the Nobilitie of <hi>Scotland</hi> to vtter deſtruction, and of their liuings and yearely reuenewes, to maintaine a thouſand men of Armes, to keepe the commons in perpetuall bondage. At the Parliament holden in Auguſt following, the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:473:192"/> Acte of Obliuion (according to the former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles) was ratified, and the queſtion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on debated, and there-vpon a confeſſion of the faith eſtabliſhed and publiſhed. Shortly after, the Earle of <hi>Morton,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> and the young Leird of <hi>Ledington</hi> repayred to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, in the behalfe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lords, to render thankes to the Queene of <hi>England</hi> for the great fauour her Maieſtie had done them, in reducing their diſtreſſed countrie to a peaceable eſtate, for the which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged them-ſelues bound vnto her for euer. In December next, <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King deceaſed, where-vpon Queene <hi>Mary</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the twentith of Auguſt the Summer following, in the yeare 1561. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1561"/> Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie after <hi>William Metlaine</hi> was ſent into <hi>England,</hi> to make knowne her ſafe arriuall, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend vnto her Maieſtie moſt kinde ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Queene his Miſtreſſe, and her great deſire to continue amitie and concorde betweene their kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Then hee preſented to her letters from the Lords, wherein after a due remembrance of thankefulneſſe for the late receiued fauours, they humbly intreated her Maieſtie, not onely to carry her ſelfe in ſuch ſort towards their Queene, that ſhee might there-by bee mooued to continue amitie with her: but that it would pleaſe her, by as ſtraight bands as poſſiblie
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:473:192"/> might bee, ſtill to binde her more and more vnto her, promiſing that for their parts they would let ſlippe no occaſion, as farre as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in their powers where-by to perpetuate the late league betweene the two nations. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the moſt aſſured meane, where-by to bury in perpetuall obliuion the memorie of all former diſſention, and clearlie to take away all occaſion of future quarrell reſted herein, that it would pleaſe her by acte of Parliament to eſtabliſh the ſucceſſion of the crowne of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (for want of iſſue of her owne body) vpon the Queene their Miſtreſſe, who in bloud was next vnto it: Hauing prooued by ſundry argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and examples, that this their requeſt was both iuſt and agreeable to the practiſe of the Kings ouer both theſe nations in former times, hee concluded that their Queene expected that fauour at her hands. Here-vnto the Queene of <hi>England</hi> anſwered. I looked for another kinde of Ambaſſage from your Queene, I maruell ſhee hath forgotten, what at length ſhee promiſed before her departure out of <hi>France,</hi> which was to ratifie the peace made at <hi>Leeth,</hi> and that immediatly after her returne into <hi>Scotland,</hi> I ſhould bee certified thereof.</p>
            <p>I haue now long enough (ſaid her Maieſtie) beene fed with faire words, it is high time (if your Queene regard her credit with vs) that her deeds be anſwerable ther-vnto. The Ambaſſador
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:473:193"/> in her excuſe anſwered, that he was ſent out of <hi>Scotland</hi> within few dayes after their Queenes returne: that ſhe had not then entred into the handling of any matter of State, but was who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie buſied in giuing intertainement to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, for the more part vnknowne vnto her: neither were they all come at his departure, whoſe aduice it was fitte ſhee ſhould vſe in a matter of that importance (eſpecially touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eſtabliſhing of Religion, which how difficult a point it was, ſhee her ſelfe knew by experience) and without whoſe conſents ſhee neither could nor ought to conclude of any thing. The Queene of <hi>England</hi> beeing heere-with more mooued, replyed. What needeth (I pray you) any further conſultation to effect that, where-vnto your Queene hath already bound her ſelfe by her hand and ſeale? what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere I ſhould make here-vnto (ſayd hee) for the preſent I know not, hauing receiued no warrant here-in from our Queene, who looked not that this point ſhould haue beene ſo farre vrged now. This is all I can ſay vnto it: Your Maieſtie may eaſilye ſee, what iuſt occaſion ſhee now hath, to deferre that buſineſſe vntill a more conuenient time, when as I doubt not, but you ſhall bee better ſatisfied. After ſome further ſpeech, her Maieſtie comming to the moſt materiall point of this ambaſſage, I well remember (ſaith ſhee) what you haue deliuered
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:473:193"/> vnto vs, in your Oration from the Nobilitie of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the behalfe of your Queene. Firſt that ſhee is the next vnto vs in bloud, and therefore I ſhould ſhew greateſt affection and loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, which wee neither will nor can denie. For the whole world can witneſſe with vs, that in all our actions we neuer attempted any thing againſt the good and ſafetie of her ſelfe or of her kingdome; that when ſhe claimed and chalenged our kingdome, and vſurped the armes of the ſame, yet neuer-the-leſſe wee could not bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, but that it proceeded rather from ſome bad counſell about her, then from her ſelfe. But how-ſo-euer it was, wee hope ſhee ſhall not bee able to take our Crowne from vs, or from my iſſue, if I leaue any ſuch to ſucceed vs. If I dye with-out children, ſhee ſhall not finde any thing done by vs, that may preiudice her right to the Crowne of <hi>England.</hi> What that is, wee neuer yet thought it needfull to examine, neither purpoſe wee heere-after to trouble our ſelfe there-with-all, but wee leaue it to them, to whom it pertaineth to looke vnto it.</p>
            <p>If your Queenes title bee good, wee will no way impaire the ſame. And I call GOD to witneſſe that for our part, wee knowe none, next my ſelfe, whome I preferre therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, or (if the matter ſhould come in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion) can exclude her. Who bee the compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titours you knowe (ſayd ſhee) well enough.
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:473:194"/> But what are they (poore ſoules) to attempt a thing ſo farre aboue their ſtrength? After ſome ſpeach more of the meane eſtate of thoſe Ladies (all being the iſſue of the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> ſecond Daughter to King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeauenth) at length ſhe concluded, that this their requeſt was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a very great weight, and that ſhe had neuer yet entred into any due conſideration thereof, and therefore it was requiſite, ſhee ſhould haue longer time to thinke better of it. After ſome few dayes, ſhee called the Ambaſſadour againe vnto her, and told him, ſhee could not finde out, what the meaning of the Lords was, to make this petition ſo preſently after their Queenes returne home, eſpecially knowing, that the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the former greeuances was not yet taken away, what other thing is it (ſaid ſhe) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, but that not-with-ſtanding the manifeſt wrong offered vs, we ſhould without further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, gratifie their Queene in yeelding to a point of that importance? if they take this courſe (ſaid ſhe) let them know, that we haue as good meanes as they, both at home and abroad, whereby to hold our right. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour anſwered, that their deſire herein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a care they had, not onely to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the aduancement of their Queene: but, that which touched them nearer, ouer their own eſtates, which by any trouble ariſing hereafter there-about, might happily fall into danger of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:473:194"/> an vtter ruine. That the Lords were imboldned the more freely and plainly to impart their mindes vnto her, by the experience they haue had of her Maieſties good affection towards them, and of the care ſhee had alwayes ſhewed ouer the continuance of their preſent eſtates, and therefore hee hoped, ſhee would make the beſt conſtructions of their meanings towards her, in this their petition, proceeding vpon ſo neceſſary conſiderations. If wee had (ſaid ſhe) attempted any thing, hurtfull to your Queenes title, then had they had good cauſe to haue moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs to take ſome other more moderate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. But to perſwade me to haue (as it were) my winding ſheete layde before me, while I liue, is ſuch a petition, as was neuer yet made to any Prince. Neuer-the-leſſe wee doe not miſlike their honeſt meaning herein, eyther in reſpect of the good towards their Queene or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For, wee muſt confeſſe, it would coſt many men on both ſides their liues, if happily any aduerſe partie amongſt thoſe competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours ſhould oppoſe her ſelfe againſt your Queene. But who ſhould ſhee bee? or what meanes can ſhee make?</p>
            <p>Well, letting this doubt paſſe, wherein there is no doubt to bee made, admit wee were incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable vnto that they deſire, would wee, thinke you, be drawne vnto it, thereby to gratifie thoſe Noblemen, rather then your Queene her ſelfe?
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:473:195"/> ſurely no. But there bee many moe reaſons then yet I haue made, to keepe vs from yeelding there-vnto. After ſhee had in a long diſcourſe declared, what ſhee had obſerued both particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerlie in the diſpoſition of her owne ſubiects: and more generally in the corrupt nature of man-kind, and with-all had alledged ſundrie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in other Chriſtian kings, how iealous they haue beene euen ouer their owne children, who by the lawes of God and Nature, were to ſucceed them: ſhee concluded, that by them ſhe was taught, how dangerous a point it was to make their Queene her knowne heire to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> the more in that ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie a mighty Princeſſe of her ſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſhould with the more difficultie, vpon ſuch a grounded hope, containe her ſelfe with-in the due bondes of lawe and equitie. Vpon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conference with her Maieſtie at another time, the Ambaſſadour at length obtained, that the former treatie of Peace, and the articles then ſet downe, ſhould bee retracted, and inlarged in this maner. That the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould no longer beare the armes of <hi>England,</hi> nor vſurpe the title of Queene ouer the ſame, during the life of the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> or of her iſſue after her. On the other-ſide, that the Queene of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould promiſe and couenant for her ſelfe, and her iſſue after her, that neither ſhee, nor they ſhould make or do any act, that might preiudice
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:473:195"/> the claime and right of ſucceſſion, which the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> hath to the Crowne of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like maner, when as after the broiles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which followed the deteſtable murthers of King <hi>Henry,</hi> the Queene of <hi>Scottes</hi> her ſecond husband, Father to the King that now raigneth, and of the Earle of <hi>Murrey</hi> their Regent, they of her faction (ſhee being then fled into <hi>England</hi> for her more ſafetie, and remaining there in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable kinde of captiuitie) practiſed her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, by ſtirring vp a dangerous rebellion in the North parts of <hi>England,</hi> and that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall conſpirators the two Earles of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> were fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and harbored there: the Queene of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued there-vnto, as well in reſpect of her owne ſafety, as of the tender and motherly care, ſhe had ouer the Infant King her neere kinſman, whoſe life was brought thereby into no leſſe danger then her owne: her Maieſtie was eaſilie drawne by the intreatie of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nobilitie of that faction, to take vpon her the defence and protection of them and that kingdome, againſt the common enimies and diſturbers of the peaceable and quiet eſtate, of the one and other Nation, who (beſides their priuie practiſes) had alſo by open hoſtilitie and inuaſion, prouoked her Maieſtie to take armes againſt them. For euen the next night, after the Regent was ſlaine,

Neither were the aduerſaries ſatisfied with this, and the like diſpleaſures ſundry times after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but they were not aſhamed with moſt deſpightfull tearmes to reproach her Maieſtie. Of this faction, the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall heads and leaders, not ſo much (as it was thought) for any good meaning towards the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queene, whoſe party they would ſeeme to take, but rather by bringing her againe into <hi>Scotland:</hi> they hoped to worke the deſtruction both of the Mother and Sonne, and there-by to ſet the Crowne of <hi>Scotland</hi> vpon ſome of their owne heads, pretending to bee next in bloud after them to the ſame. The Queene of <hi>England</hi> being thus prouoked to reuenge, by her aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries on the one ſide, and on the other ſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by her well-willers, to ioyne with them againſt thoſe, who were enimies both to her and their owne King, commanded the Earle of <hi>Suſſex</hi> (Lord Lieutenant then of the <hi>North</hi> parts) to gather ſuch forces there, as he thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, where-with-all to enter into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſo as on the eighteenth day of Aprill, in the yeare 1570. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1570"/> that realme was together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded from all the three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Marches. The
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:473:196"/> principall Armie was conducted by the Lord Lieutenant himſelf, accompanied with the Lord <hi>Hunſden</hi> Gouernor of <hi>Barwick,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Drewrie</hi> Marſhall there. The next was lead by Sir <hi>Iohn Foſter</hi> warden of the middle Marches: the third by the Lord <hi>Scroope</hi> warden of the Weſt Marches. The two former, entring into <hi>Tiuidale,</hi> waſted and deſtroyed what-ſo-euer ſtood in their way, vntill they met at <hi>Crawling,</hi> where they alſo raſed the Caſtell. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence paſſing to <hi>Iedworth,</hi> they were ſo well intertained, that in requitall thereof, they forbare to doe any harme there. Departing thence, the Armie ſundry times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided it ſelfe, the more to afflict the countries where they paſſed: Vpon the two and twentith of the ſame moneth they returned together to <hi>Barwick.</hi>

In theſe iourneyes, aboue fiftie Caſtells and places of ſtrength, and not ſo few as three hundred Townes, Villages, and dwellings, were raſed, burned, and ſpoiled: ſo as none well neere in all thoſe parts, who had either receiued the <hi>Engliſh</hi> rebels, or had by inuaſion indamaged the borders of <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> had left vnto them, dwellings

This Caſtell was committed to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie of Captaine <hi>Wood</hi> and Captaine <hi>Pickman,</hi> with whom leauing a garriſon of two hundred ſouldiers, hee returned againe to <hi>Berwicke.</hi> At this ſiedge but foure were ſlaine on both ſides, two <hi>Engliſh</hi> and two <hi>Scottiſhmen.</hi> The fourth of <hi>May,</hi> the Lord Generall lying ſicke at <hi>Berwicke,</hi> ſent Maiſter <hi>Drewrie</hi> with ſome two thouſand men, to take <hi>Fast</hi> Caſtell, which vpon the firſt ſummons yeelded it ſelfe; it was kept by halfe a ſcore <hi>Scottes,</hi> and committed to the cuſtody of as many <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> who were thought able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hold it againſt all the powre of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the ſame by ſcituation was naturally ſo ſtrong.

In the meane while for the better aſſurance of ſuch couenants, as were agreed vnto by thoſe Lords (at whoſe intreaty alſo this aide was granted) certaine hoſtages were ſent into <hi>England.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Chateau,</hi> &amp; his adherents of the aduerſe
<pb facs="tcp:473:198"/> partie, hearing of the approach of the <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> was latelie departed thence, and had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed his armie, hauing firſt attempted and failed of the taking of the Caſtell of <hi>Glaſcoe</hi> with ſome loſſe of his men, but more of his honour. The matter of greateſt importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce atcheeued by the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> there aſſociates, at this iorney, was the taking of <hi>Hamilton</hi> Caſtell, which was preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly raiſed.

But ſuch was the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this worthy Gentleman, ouer the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent offenders, both now and before, that a <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> writer hath brought him into ſome ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ouer much partiality towards the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, although the ſame Author co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth that the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> in all this iorney ſpared neither the goods, lands nor houſes of any of the <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> or other that were either ſuſpected of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with the murtherer of the Regent, or had receiued into their protection any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> rebells, eſpecially all along the tract of the riuer of <hi>Cloid,</hi> where for the moſt part their poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s lay.
